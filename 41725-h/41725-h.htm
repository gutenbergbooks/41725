<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS volume is intended to serve as a guide to the diagnosis
and to the treatment of the diseases and conditions of the
body in general, in their relation to the foot, as well as to
those conditions which primarily affect this member.</p>

<p>Much of the matter herein contained might be regarded as
beyond the scope of Chiropody; this, however, is a fallacy not
more applicable to Chiropody than to any other specialized branch
of Surgery requiring a knowledge of the physiologic and pathologic
processes at work in the production of disease.</p>

<p>The advances made in this branch of Surgery have long since
translated it from the realm of empiricism to the field of rationalism.
Treatment based primarily on the results of experience or
observation must give place to a system based upon a knowledge
of abnormal conditions and the resultant changes in the tissues.
Such knowledge elicits treatment directed definitely against these
processes. It is obvious that this can be accomplished only through
the agency of certain definite manual and therapeutic measures,
the physiologic actions of which are well understood and known to
be reliable.</p>

<p>Much stress has been laid upon the subject of asepsis and
antisepsis. The foot is peculiar in that conditions surrounding it
are especially congenial to the development and multiplication of
bacteria. Modern surgery has been built upon the recognition of
the r&ocirc;le of bacteria in the behaviour of wounds, and the greatest
hazard to successful surgery lies in the ever-present possibility of
bacterial invasion. Surgical safety, however, can be secured by
the employment of a perfect technic for asepsis. Once the precept
is established that the operative field must be asepticized
and thereafter protected from contact with any septic object,
the status of Podiatry will be secure for all time. Should we
accomplish this, these pages will have served a purpose.</p>

<p>Two notable features of the present volume are a comprehensive
glossary and an exhaustive index which greatly enhance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
its usefulness, enabling the reader to find references to the subject
before him, and with very little inconvenience to learn the
meanings of unfamiliar words, thus obviating the necessity for
a medical dictionary.</p>

<p>We avail ourselves of this opportunity to acknowledge our
gratitude to Dr. Maurice J. Lewi for his assistance in editing
and in publishing our work in keeping with his estimate of its
possible field of usefulness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>

<p>Surgery, in contradistinction to medicine, as a separate
branch of the healing art, includes all manual
procedures and is not limited to cutting operations exclusively.
It is that branch which deals with the treatment of
morbid conditions by means of manual or instrumental
agencies.</p>

<p>Morbid conditions include three distinct classes: those
due to</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. Injuries</div>
<div class="line">2. Infections</div>
<div class="line">3. Diseases</div>
</div></div>

<p><b>Injuries.</b> To this class belong all the processes due to
physical agencies and it includes besides traumatism, the
effects of heat and cold, of chemicals, of light and of
electricity.</p>

<p><b>Infections.</b> These may be either local or general. The
reaction might occur at the point of entrance of the bacteria,
or constitutional symptoms may evidence their invasion into
the blood, or the absorption of their toxic products.</p>

<p>Many conditions in this class are linked closely with
those in the following class:</p>

<p><b>Diseases.</b> Here are classified (<i>a</i>) new growths, both
benign and malignant; (<i>b</i>) changes due to age and environment,
and (<i>c</i>) diseases not belonging in either of the above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
classes. These latter are generally known as <i>idiopathic</i> or
<i>spontaneous</i> in their etiology. These terms, however, often
indicate only a limit of knowledge as to their true etiology.</p>

<p><b>The Tissues.</b> The tissues of the body, though apparently
so different and varying so decidedly in their functions,
are in many respects similar.</p>

<p>Every tissue is composed of two parts: the <i>cellular
elements</i> and the <i>intercellular substance</i>. These are called
<i>cells</i> and <i>stroma</i>. Upon the first of these depends the vitality
and function of the part, while its density, shape and
general physical properties are determined by the second.
Likewise along the same lines of reason, all of our organs
have two separate areas of tissue: the <i>parenchymatous</i> and
the <i>interstitial</i>. The first contains the functioning and the
second the supporting elements.</p>

<p>The physical conditions of the interstitial tissue or the
intercellular substance vary greatly in density. <i>Blood</i> is a
tissue, the intercellular constituent of which is fluid, and as
we consider more dense tissues, we encounter all degrees of
density of the framework or intercellular substance, until
with the additional presence of calcareous elements, we conceive
the hardness of bone and dentine. Tissues as a whole,
however, are not solid; there are spaces in the supporting
structure to admit of the passage of arteries, veins, nerves,
and lymphatics.</p>

<p>Abnormal conditions arise in the various parts of the
tissues. Certain diseases affect the parenchymatous tissue
in an organ more than the interstitial tissue and again others
affect the blood vessels particularly.</p>

<p>There may be <i>hypertrophy</i>, in which the entire organ
or part becomes larger as a whole, the active cells and
stroma sharing alike in the process, or there may be an
<i>hyperplasia</i>, in which the active cells of the part proliferate
abnormally. When the interstitial tissue alone develops
excessively it is known as an <i>infiltration</i>. Under such circumstances
the parenchymatous cells often undergo what
is termed <i>pressure atrophy</i>; they are diminished by
squeezing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Atrophy</i> of the part or organ, from whatever source,
signifies its diminution in size; its function is, of course,
either impaired or suspended as the process goes on.</p>

<p>The efforts on the part of the organism as a whole to
combat or repair injury, bacterial invasion and disease are
directed along definite lines. The study of these functions
does not rightly come within the scope of these pages, belonging
to physiology, but must be considered here, if only
in brief for the purpose of a good understanding of the
processes at work in surgical conditions.</p>

<p>As surgeons, the functions which concern us most
are the</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. Nervous</div>
<div class="line">2. Circulatory</div>
<div class="line">3. Lymphatic</div>
</div></div>

<h3><b>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</b></h3>

<p>The nerves operate in harmony with each other and with
the organs to maintain health. The nervous system comprises
the brain, the spinal cord, the nerves, and the ganglia.
Aside from presiding over the special senses, this system
controls and directs the processes of defense and repair. In
doing so, the force and frequency of the heart beat, the
calibre of the vessels and the chemistry and composition of
the blood are all altered.</p>

<p>These phenomena are the ones which concern us in our
present subject, acting as they do upon the blood and the
organs which contain it. They will be considered more
fully in the following:</p>

<h3><b>THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</b></h3>

<p>In health and disease the force and frequency of the
heart beat and the calibre of the arteries undergo momentary
alterations to meet changes surrounding us.</p>

<p>Dilatation and constriction of the arteries, and arterioles
through the activity of the vasomotor nerves, permit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
increasing and diminishing amounts of blood reaching the
various organs and regions of the body. In this way the
peripheral circulation, through the activity of the heat centre
in the brain, acting upon the superficial capillaries,
maintains the normal temperature of the body during the
changes of season. In winter, heat conservation is effected
by vaso-constriction of the superficial capillaries, while in
summer, heat radiation is accomplished by vaso-dilatation
together with the evaporation of moisture so abundantly
supplied by the active sweat glands. Other phenomena
demonstrating the vasomotor function are blushing, going
pale, and the redness and swelling following injury or infection.
Of the latter we will treat under the heading
&#8220;Inflammation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certain changes also occur in the blood in order that
it may perform its functions. These changes are found
both in the chemistry of its fluid content and in the number
and kind of its solid elements: the corpuscles. The blood
is a tissue; its corpuscles are the functioning cells and its
fluid content the basement substance.</p>

<p>In the fluid content of the blood or <i>plasma</i>, as it is
called, certain chemical changes occur in its fibrin-forming
capacity. Clot formation, an effort on the part of the
economy to arrest hemorrhage, is thus facilitated when there
is active bleeding, also during labor and certain diseases.</p>

<p>The number and kind of white blood cells also undergo
changes, as we shall see, under circumstances in which the
defences of the organism are called into operation, for it is
the function of the white blood corpuscles to combat bacterial
invasion.</p>

<p>It is the preponderance of these white cells which imparts
the peculiar milky color to pus.</p>

<p>Nourishment and oxygen are carried to the tissues by
the red blood corpuscles. Under circumstances which we
shall see later, these are also altered both in number and
in size, and also in their arrangement in the vessels. (See
Chapter IV, &#8220;<i>Inflammation</i>.&#8221;)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h3><b>THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM</b></h3>

<p>Waste material in the tissues is carried off by the
return blood in the veins and also by the lymphatics. These
are in reality the scavengers of the body, both the lymphatic
vessels and glands, performing important functions for the
good of the economy. They are found beneath the skin
and in the subcutaneous tissue, also along the course of
the great veins.</p>

<p>The lymphatics far exceed the veins in number and
perform a function similar to the veins, gathering waste
material from the tissues, also the digested food called
<i>chyle</i>, from the stomach and intestines. The lymphatic vessels,
also the lacteals which absorb the chyle, all pass
through glands, which are extremely numerous, where certain
deleterious substances are extracted from the lymph
before it is emptied into the blood stream.</p>

<p>The lymphatic glands in performing their function as
filters often become inflamed and when large numbers of
pathogenic bacteria, or very virulent ones are contained in
a gland, abscess formation results just as it would in any
tissue so invaded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><b>SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY</b></h3>

<p>A <i>microorganism</i> or <i>microbe</i>, some species of which
cause all disease, is a minute plant or animal too small,
as a rule, to be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The word <i>germ</i> may be used to designate any microorganism,
but it has so many other meanings and has been
so loosely employed even in this sense, that it cannot be
used for accurate scientific description.</p>

<p><i>Bacteria</i> are minute plants on the order of fungae,
many of which are able to produce fermentation, decomposition
or disease.</p>

<p>Although the word <i>bacterium</i> by derivation has the
same meaning as <i>bacillus</i> and indicates a rod shaped fungus,
it has been so loosely employed that it may very well be
applied to the entire germal family, retaining the word
bacillus in the narrower sense.</p>

<p><b>Description of Bacteria.</b> <i>Schizomycetes</i> is the name
given all the bacteria of putrefaction and disease, the former
being called <i>saprophytic</i> and the latter <i>pathogenic</i>.</p>

<p>Bacteria are minute fungi, each consisting of a single
cell enclosed in a cell membrane of cellulose which can be
demonstrated by iodine, the latter causing the protoplasm
to retract from the cell wall. There is no nucleus or central
core. Some of the bacteria are colorless, others pigmented,
yellow, blue or red. The cells vary in shape and in size
in different species as well as in their mode of growth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
are named in accordance with these peculiarities. The
round or oval cells are called <i>cocci</i>; the rod-shaped organisms
are termed <i>bacilli</i>. The cocci are called <i>micrococci</i> or
<i>macrococci</i> according to their size; <i>diplococci</i> or <i>tetracocci</i>,
according to the production of pairs or groups of four
in their multiplication; <i>streptococci</i>, because in their
growth they always form chains of cells; <i>staphylococci</i>, because
they grow in irregular clusters resembling bunches
of grapes. Some of the bacteria have the power of motion
generally produced by cilia or flagella and others are motionless.</p>

<p><b>Habitat.</b> These organisms may truly be said to be
omnipresent. Every thing we wear or use or eat, even the
air itself, is impregnated with them. Pathogenic germs
may also be found among these myriads. Every species has
its own particular habitat, where the conditions especially
favor its growth, just as any of the larger plants require
a certain soil, a supply of water, temperature, and proper
amount of light in order to make growth and multiplication
possible.</p>

<p>The bacteria in the air are more numerous in dry
weather, being carried up as dust by the wind, for a moist
surface holds any bacteria which may lie upon it. So complete
is the action of moisture, that air, which contained 600
microorganisms when inspired, has been shown to return
from the lungs with almost none, the moist respiratory surfaces
catching and holding the bacteria; so that the expired
air is practically sterilized; this is true even when the expiration
is from diseased lungs. The act of coughing,
however, may expel bacteria in the mucus ejected. The
number of bacteria in the air is very variable, but is much
greater in houses than out of doors, and is naturally increased
by attempts to clean the rooms.</p>

<p><b>Parasitic Nature.</b> The number of species of pathogenic
germs is comparatively small compared with the number of
all the varieties of germs, for the latter are practically innumerable.
Indeed, the wonderful qualities of resistance
in animal tissues is the only thing that makes animal life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
possible and it is this power of resistance that allows certain
wounds to heal by primary union when left without
protection or care.</p>

<p>The schizomycetes are unable to extract nitrogen from
the air or the soil, like the higher vegetables, and must,
therefore, be provided with a higher nitrogenous compound,
such as is produced by vegetable and animal life. Some of
them are able to live upon dead organic matter, while others
cannot exist without living tissues to feed upon and are
therefore true parasites. There are some which are able
to live upon either dead or living tissues and are known as
<i>facultative parasites</i>, a class which includes a majority of
pathogenic germs. Some organisms require albuminous
matter, others need carbohydrates; they all require water,
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and certain inorganic materials,
especially lime and potassium. All organisms require water.
If dried, no form will multiply, and many forms will die.</p>

<p>The fluids and tissues of the individual may or may not
afford a favorable soil for the germs of a disease, or, in
the same person afford it at one time, and not at another.
Some individuals seem to possess indestructible immunity
from, and others are especially prone to, certain contagious
diseases. Impairment of health, by alterating some subtle
condition of the soil, may make a person liable who previously
was exempt.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Oxygen.</b> Some bacteria need free oxygen;
some can live either with or without free oxygen, while
others cannot live at all in the presence of free oxygen.
Those requiring oxygen are called <i>aerobic</i>; those which can
live with or without it are called <i>facultative aerobic</i>; those
which do not live in free oxygen are called <i>anaerobic</i>.</p>

<p>Bacteria are very sensitive to temperature, few being
able to live in a temperature below 68&deg;F. or 29&deg;C. or above
104&deg;F. or 40&deg;C. The pathogenic varieties thrive best at
about the normal temperature of the blood. Direct sunlight
retards their growth and may kill them. Freezing renders
bacteria motionless and incapable of multiplication, but it
does not kill them; they again become active when the temperature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
is raised. The absurdity of employing cold as a
germicide is evident when it is known that a temperature
of 200&deg;F. below zero is not fatal to germ life, cell activities
by such a temperature only being rendered dormant. The
high temperatures are fatal to bacteria, moist heat being
more destructive than dry heat, and adult cells are more
easily killed than spores. A temperature less than 212&deg;F.
will kill many organisms and boiling will kill every pathogenic
organism that does not form spores. Some spores are
not destroyed after prolonged boiling and some will withstand
a temperature of 120&deg;C. As a practical fact, however,
boiling water kills in a few minutes all cocci, most bacilli,
and all pathogenic spores, though anthrax and tetanus are
harder to kill than are the spores of other bacteria.</p>

<p>Under favorable conditions bacteria multiply rapidly,
but when conditions are unfavorable, they take on a spore
formation and remain in a quiescent state, like the seed of
a plant, waiting&#8212;it may be years&#8212;until proper conditions
are present. The spores are protected by such a thick envelope
and have such great potential vitality, that it is much
more difficult to kill them than the developed bacteria. Certain
spores that withstand 212&deg;F. or 100&deg;C., can be killed
when fully developed at 130&deg;F. or 55&deg;C.</p>

<p><b>Toxins.</b> As bacteria grow, certain poisonous chemical
substances appear about them. These poisons are produced
by them directly, or are formed in the organic matter or
tissues in which they live, as the result of their presence.
Some of these substances are alkaloidal and are known as
<i>ferments</i> or <i>ptomains</i>. Others are albuminous in nature
and are called <i>toxalbumins</i>. The ptomains and toxalbumins
are exceedingly powerful poisons, producing local necrosis,
inflammation and even suppuration, when introduced by
themselves and entirely free from living germs, into the
tissues of animals. Pathogenic bacteria abstract the lymph
from the blood. As the lymph contains elements necessary
to the body, such as water, oxygen, albumins, carbohydrates,
etc., their loss brings about body-waste and exhaustion from
lack of nourishment. Again, bacteria produce a vast number
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of compounds, some harmless and others highly
poisonous.</p>

<p>The symptoms of a microbic disease are largely due
to the absorption of poisonous materials from the area of
infection. These poisons may be formed in the tissues by
the action upon them of the bacteria, or they may be liberated
from the bodies of degenerating microbes.</p>

<p>Bacteria secrete and contain ferments like pepsin or
trypsin, and as albumoses are formed in the alimentary
canal by the action of the digestive ferments upon proteids,
sugars, and starches, so microbic albumoses are formed by
the action of microbic ferments upon tissues.</p>

<p>The local and general symptoms of these toxins depend
upon the particular toxin employed and a large number of
these poisons have been isolated and studied. Those of the
surgically important pathogenic germs, produce inflammation
locally, with general symptoms of fever, chills, cardiac
depression, irritation of the kidneys and bowels and cerebral
symptoms, such as delirium and coma. The toxalbumins
also appear to have the effect of destroying the bacteria to
which they owe their origin when they have been produced
in large quantity.</p>

<p><b>Cultivation.</b> Bacteria are cultivated for study in the
laboratory in meat extracts, in gelatine, or agar agar (a
sort of vegetable gelatine), or raw potato, in blood serum
and in other materials. The simplest method of cultivation
is in bouillon, sterilized in flasks, with cotton plugs. Another
method of studying bacteria is by the inoculation of
animals.</p>

<p><b>Infection.</b> Bacteria gain admission to the living tissues
under natural conditions, by penetrating any of the mucous
membranes which they can reach, or by entering open
wounds. It may be said in general that an intact epidermis
is almost a complete protection against infection, and that
an intact mucous membrane is a good protection. This difference
in vulnerability between the mucous membrane and
the skin is important, and is probably due to the cornifaction
of the epithelial cells, and to their numerous layers, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
well as to the protection afforded by the thick corium. The
single layer of soft mucous cells is much more easily
penetrated.</p>

<p>Typhoid bacilli and other hostile germs have been actually
observed in the urine, in the bile, in the intestinal
secretions and in the saliva. The bacteria of typhoid fever
and tuberculosis have been found in the milk of nursing
mothers.</p>

<p>The local phenomena of inflammation usually follow the
introduction of living bacteria into the tissues, and general
symptoms of poisoning follow later, when the bacteria,
toxins, or ptomains, have entered the circulation. Some
bacteria, however, excite no local reaction, but enter the
circulation at once. The pyogenic variety, it should be
noted, cause the production of pus.</p>

<p><b>Elimination.</b> Bacteria can be eliminated from the blood
in several ways; the kidneys, however, are the organs which
carry the burden of most frequently relieving the body of
them. Even the sweat glands are supposed to eliminate
both bacterial toxins and bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Resistance Offered by Tissues.</b> The tissues have considerable
power of resistance under ordinary circumstances,
although the exact sources of this power are not well under
stood. <i>Phagocytosis</i>&#8212;the power of destruction and removal
of bacteria supposedly possessed by the leucocytes emigrating
from the blood vessels&#8212;explains it in part. It is
also accounted for by the germicidal properties of the blood
serum.</p>

<p>The resistance of the tissues may in some cases be due
to the absence from them of some particular element necessary
to the growth of a particular microorganism. This refractoriness
varies in every species of animal in its relation
to every form of germ. Different individuals of one species
also vary in their susceptibility, and even different parts of
the body vary in the same individual. The lower animals
offer a greater resistance to pyogenic bacteria than do
human beings.</p>

<p>Any cause that lowers the vitality by depressing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
system, reduces the resistance to bacteria and is therefore
apt to favor their growth. Exhausting diseases such as
anemia, obesity, alcoholism, diabetes, fatigue, or even exposure
to cold, are instances. Germ growth is also favored
by the presence of dead, or injured tissues, of blood clots,
of foreign substances, and above all, by the presence of
some of the substances in which the germ has already been
growing at the time of its inoculation, and containing some
of its toxins.</p>

<p><b>Immunity.</b> To be able to resist the invasion of any
species of bacteria, one is said to be refractory to or immune
against that variety of germs.</p>

<p>Serum therapy is based on the demonstrated fact of
immunity, and of the possibility of producing it by injecting
the serum of immunized animals. In many infectious diseases,
one attack protects an individual for a lifetime and
one form of disease may protect against even a more virulent
form, as vaccination protects against smallpox. It
is a fact that if the serum of an animal which has been
rendered immune to a certain disease be injected into a
susceptible animal, the same immunity can be produced
temporarily in the second animal. Serum therapy proves
that the injected serum will not only confer immunity
against the infection, but will enable the animal to throw
off an already existing infection.</p>

<p><b>Sterilization.</b> The question how to destroy microorganisms
is one of the most important in bacteriology. Exactly
how chemical antiseptics act in suspending the growth
in living organisms and yet leaving them capable of restoration,
is not understood. The explanation is offered that
the antiseptics enter into combination with the capsule of
the cell and can be freed from it by breaking up this chemical
combination. It has always been evident that very minute
quantities of germicidal substances, and some substances
which are not germicidal, would prevent the growth of
bacteria, so that it is not surprising that chemical disinfectants
should act in this prolonged inhibitory way. It must
be remembered that in operative surgical work, germs which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
will not develop are, for practical purposes, as good as dead;
therefore such results do not invalidate the present methods
of sterilization for operations. They naturally stimulate
interest in the discovery of better methods of sterilization
and especially in the thorough application of the methods
upon which we are now depending, in order to obtain the
best possible results from them. There are three ways of
destroying microorganisms: (1) by deprivation of food and
water, (2) by chemicals (including toxins), (3) by heat.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Antiseptics.</b> For practical disinfection,
chemicals and heat need only concern us. The power of
these substances is greatly decreased by heat, grease, oil,
mucus, and even blood will cover germs with a coating which
prevents chemical germicides from reaching them. Among
the ordinary germicides, bichloride of mercury, iodin, alcohol
and carbolic acid, are of the greatest importance. A source
of error in the direct application of these experiments is
the fact that many of these chemicals are decomposed or
rendered inert, by combinations with the albuminoids of
blood and pus, mercuric bichloride being transformed
into an indifferent substance and even carbolic acid being
altered.</p>

<p><b>Carbolic Acid</b> is a valuable germicide in the strength
of from 1 to 40, to 1 to 20. It is very irritant to tissues
and carbolized dressings may be responsible for the sloughing
of a wound. It is inert in fatty tissues.</p>

<p>Carbolic acid is readily absorbed, and may thus produce
toxic symptoms. One of the early signs of absorption
is the appearance of the urine, which may assume a smoky,
greenish or blackish hue. Examination shows a great
diminution or entire absence of sulphates, when the acidulated
urine is heated with chloride of barium. The urine
also contains albumin. The appearance of the urine is an
indication that the use of the drug must be discontinued.</p>

<p><b>Kreolin</b>, a preparation made from coal tar, is a germicide
without irritant or toxic effects. It is less powerful
than carbolic acid, but acts similarly, and is used in emulsion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of a strength of from 1 to 15%. It does not irritate the
skin like carbolic acid.</p>

<p><b>Peroxide of Hydrogen</b> is a most admirable agent for the
destruction of pus cocci. It probably destroys the albuminous
element upon which the bacteria live, and starves the
fungi.</p>

<p>Peroxide is not fatal to tetanus bacilli.</p>

<p><b>Iodoform</b> is largely used, but it is not a germicide as
bacteria will grow upon it. It hinders the development of
bacteria and directly antagonizes the toxic products of germ
life.</p>

<p><b>Silver Nitrate</b> is a valuable antiseptic. It exerts an
inhibitive action upon the growth of microorganisms, but
irritates the tissues.</p>

<p><b>Formaldehyde</b> has valuable antiseptic properties.
Formalin is a 40% solution of the gas in water. Solutions
of this strength are very irritant to the tissues, but a 2%
solution can be used to disinfect wounds and instruments.</p>

<p><b>Nucleins</b>, especially protonuclein, possess germicidal
powers. Protonuclein is of value in treating areas of infection,
particularly when sloughing exists. A great many
other antiseptics are used.</p>

<p><b>Heat</b>. The surest and quickest method of destroying
bacteria is by heat. Even the spores succumb to it. Anthrax
spores are killed in 2 minutes in boiling water, and the
various bacilli and cocci in from 2 to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>When a substance to be sterilized by heat will not bear
so high a temperature, the method of fractional sterilization
is employed, the fluid to be sterilized being heated to
from 140&deg;F. to 175&deg;F. or to from 69&deg;C. to 80&deg;C., for
from 15 to 30 minutes every 3 days or 7 days. The theory
is that the adult germs are killed by the first heating and
that any spores which develop subsequently are destroyed
in their adult state at the next heating. The fluid, meanwhile,
must be kept at an even temperature which will encourage
the development of any spores it may contain. Even
anthrax spores may be killed by 167&deg;F. to 185&deg;F., or
75&deg;C. to 80&deg;C., in a one and four-tenths solution of bicarbonate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of soda, in from 8 to 20 minutes. Dry heat is not
so efficient as moist heat.</p>

<p>The following are the more important bacteria we meet
in surgical conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i>&#8212;a microorganism
producing yellow pus.</p>

<p><i>Staphylococcus pyogenes citreus</i>&#8212;a microorganism
producing lemon-colored pus.</p>

<p><i>Staphylococcus pyogenes albus</i>&#8212;a microorganism
producing white pus.</p>

<p><i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>&#8212;a streptococcus producing
pus. (Erysipelas for example).</p>

<p><i>Micrococcus gonorrhea</i>&#8212;bacillus of Neisser, or
gonococcus.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus pyocyaneous</i>&#8212;producing a green pus.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus coli communis</i>&#8212;producing intestinal conditions.
(Appendicitis for example).</p>

<p><i>Bacillus typhosis</i>&#8212;Eberth&#8217;s bacillus; producing
typhoid fever.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus tuberculosis</i>&#8212;Koch&#8217;s bacillus; producing
tuberculosis.</p>

<p><i>Bacillus tetani</i>&#8212;Nicolaier&#8217;s bacillus; causing
tetanus.</p>

<p><i>Treponema pallidum</i>, or <i>spirochaeta pallida</i> of
Hoffman and Schaudin&#8212;a protoza causing
syphilis.</p></div>

<p>The first six are known as <i>pyogenic bacteria</i>, as they
all produce pus; in addition to the above there are many
more microorganisms, but from a surgical standpoint those
mentioned are the most important.</p>

<p>The <i>staphylococcus pyogenes</i> is a spherical coccus of
somewhat variable size but averaging about 8 microns; when
properly stained it can often be seen to be formed of two
separate hemispheres. In pus it is generally found in small
heaps containing from two to ten members, but it also occurs
singly and in pairs, and even in short chains like the streptococcus,
thus rendering diagnosis difficult with the microscope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
alone. Its cultures are of a yellowish tinge. The
aureus type is the most usual cause of abscesses (circumscribed
suppurations) and 77% of acute abscesses are due
to the staphylococci.</p>

<p>The <i>staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i> is a facultative
anaerobic parasite which is widely distributed in nature,
and is found in the soil, in the dust of air, in water, in the
alimentary canal, under the nails, and in the superficial
layers of the skin. It forms the characteristic color only
when it grows in air. It is killed in ten minutes by a moist
temperature of 58&deg;C. and is instantly killed by boiling water.
Carbolic acid (1 to 40) and bichloride of mercury (1 to
2000) are quickly fatal to these cocci.</p>

<p><i>Staphylococcus pyogenes citreus</i>, the lemon-colored
coccus, is found occasionally in acute circumscribed suppurations,
but far more rarely than the other two forms.
Its pyogenic power is even weaker than that of the albus.</p>

<p><i>Staphylococcus pyogenes albus</i>, the white coccus, acts
like the aureus, but is more feeble in power. When this
organism is found upon and in the skin, it is called
<i>staphylococcus epidermis albus</i>, an organism which is the
cause of stitch abscesses.</p>

<p><i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> is found in spreading suppurations
and in very acute abscesses. About 16% of acute
abscesses contain streptococci. It is easily killed by boiling,
and can be destroyed by carbolic acid and by corrosive sublimate.
The streptococcus of erysipelas is thought to be
identical with the streptococcus pyogenes, but their difference
in action is believed to be due to difference in virulence
induced by external conditions and by the state of the tissues
of the host. The coccus of erysipelas is larger than
the ordinary form of streptococcus pyogenes, and infection
takes place through a wound, often a very trivial one, or
through a mucous membrane. The organism multiplies in
the small lymph channels. The streptococcus may cause suppuration
in erysipelas, mixed infection not being necessary
to cause pus to form.</p>

<p>The <i>gonococcus</i> of Neisser is found both inside and outside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of pus cells and mucous cells. The gonococci cannot
be cultivated upon ordinary media, but grow best upon
human-blood serum. Gonococci stain easily and are readily
decolorized by Gram&#8217;s method.</p>

<p>The <i>bacillus coli communis</i>, or the bacillus of Escherich,
is invariably found in the f&aelig;ces. It is believed by many
observers to be the cause of appendicitis, peritonitis, and
abscesses about the intestine. In cases of appendicitis we
can rarely get a pure culture of Escherich&#8217;s bacillus, but
usually find also streptococci and staphylococci.</p>

<p>The <i>bacillus of typhoid fever</i> (Eberth&#8217;s bacillus) is responsible
for some cases of gangrene, for some of embolism
and for not a few bone and joint diseases.</p>

<p>The <i>bacillus tuberculosis</i> (Koch&#8217;s bacillus), the cause
of all tubercular processes, is met with especially in dusty
air which contains the dried sputum of victims of tuberculosis.
This infected air is the chief means of its transmission,
though it may be conveyed by the milk of tubercular
cows and by the meat of tubercular animals. Wounds may
open a gateway for infection.</p>

<p>The <i>bacillus tetani</i> (Nicolaier&#8217;s bacillus), an aerobic
organism, is found especially in the soil of gardens, in the
dust of old buildings, in street dirt, and in the sweepings
of stables. Spores develop at the ends of these bacilli. This
organism is capable of producing toxins of deadly power.
Its spores are hard to kill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><b>ASEPSIS AND ANTISEPSIS</b></h3>

<p>Before the introduction of Lister&#8217;s methods of treating
wounds, it was considered proper, in accidental and operative
wounds, to have profuse suppuration, pyemia, erysipelas,
etc., and it was not remarkable, therefore, that the mortality
following accidental and operative wounds was very
high. Lister&#8217;s method of wound treatment was largely based
upon the conception that the infection of wounds occurred
from contact with the air which contained spores and germs,
and his method of treatment therefore, was directed chiefly
to their destruction. The air can be a medium of wound
infection to a certain extent, and dry air contains more
spores and bacteria than moist air, but Koch demonstrated
the fact that atmospheric microbes were chiefly of innocuous
character, and wound infection usually could be traced to
bacteria or spores being brought into direct contact with
wounds, by the clothing, or by the skin of the patient, or
by the hands of the surgeon, or by unclean surgical instruments
and dressings. The antiseptic qualities of the blood
serum and cell activities in healthy tissues, are sufficient
to destroy or remove a certain number of microorganisms,
and suppuration occurs only when the tissues are completely
overwhelmed by the number of these organisms or when
their power of resistance is lessened by injury or disease.</p>

<p><b>Sepsis.</b> Sepsis is due to the entrance and multiplication
of microbes, or to the absorption of their products in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
body. Local inflammation and marked constitutional symptoms
characterize sepsis.</p>

<p><b>Asepsis.</b> Asepsis aims at thorough sterilization of the
parts and of all the objects brought into contact with the
wounds, and the exclusion of germs by the use of occlusive
bandages and dressings.</p>

<p><b>Antisepsis</b> is that method of wound treatment which
keeps germicidal agents continuously in direct contact with
the wound. Its object, therefore, is to produce asepsis. It
is the duty of the surgeon to guard against the contact of
microorganisms in the wound and to employ whatever means
science has evolved for their destruction. He must, however,
be careful to employ means of disinfection or destruction
that will not have an injurious effect upon the normal
tissues.</p>

<p>Mechanical disinfection does not apply to wounds but
is employed as a preventive measure by the operator and
his assistants for instruments and for the skin surrounding
the wounds. Mechanical disinfection is accomplished by
the use of soap and water and a friction brush; germicidal
solutions of one kind or another are also employed.</p>

<p>In the modern aseptic operating room germicides and
antiseptics do not play so important a part as they formerly
did. This is largely due to the fact that heat is used
wherever possible in the preparation of sutures, ligatures,
dressings and instruments, and to the farther fact that in
uninfected tissues no antiseptic solutions are employed. It
must also be remembered that the germicidal agents possess
the disadvantage of exercising a more or less destructive
action on the body cells, and consequently their use is not
warranted in clean wounds. We still, however, sufficiently
often meet with infected wounds that render the use of these
agents necessary.</p>

<p><b>Heat</b> is the most valuable of all sterilizing agents, its
only drawback being that it is not universally applicable.
Wherever possible it should be employed in preference to
chemical agents. It can be employed either dry or moist.
Moist heat is a much more efficacious germicide than dry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
heat, for it destroys the organisms at a much lower temperature.
Boiling water at a temperature of 212&deg;F. will
destroy nearly instantaneously all pus-producing organisms.
Spores, however, require a moist heat of 284&deg;F. kept up
for at least a half-hour. A dry heat of 212&deg;F. will not
destroy pus-producing organisms under an hour and a half
of treatment, and spores will live for three hours at a dry
temperature of 284&deg;F.</p>

<p>Although moist heat is very much quicker and more
satisfactory in its action, yet it is often inconvenient to
employ it in the sterilization of gowns, towels, operating
suits, etc. However, sterilization by heat has been greatly
facilitated by the introduction of the autoclave, by means
of which a very high temperature under pressure can be
obtained. This is the most satisfactory method of sterilizing
dressings, towels, sheets, operating suits and aprons.
A similar and less expensive method of sterilizing these
articles is by the use of one of the simple steam sterilizers
which are sold by all dealers. In an emergency, an ordinary
bake oven can be employed as a sterilizer. It is best, however,
where the temperature cannot be estimated, to boil
the articles and dry them between sheets moistened with
bichloride solution.</p>

<p><b>Disinfection or Sterilization.</b> Sterilization of a wound,
or of the substances coming in contact with it, may be accomplished
by using the aseptic or antiseptic method; by
combining these two methods we obtain the best results.
The aseptic method, which employs antiseptic substances
for the purpose of sterilization of objects coming in contact
with the wound when their disinfection by heat is impossible,
is the method perhaps most generally favored by
modern surgeons.</p>

<p><b>Antiseptic Method.</b> In the antiseptic method, the field
of operation, the hands of the operator and of his assistants,
and the instruments, must be treated in germicidal solution
and, in addition, the wound should be frequently irrigated
during the operation with a solution that has germicidal
properties.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Recent investigations show that many germicidal substances
have not the power that was formerly attributed to
them. Furthermore, substances which are really active
germicides very often produce a marked toxic effect upon
the patient and produce a very decided irritation of the
skin with which they come in contact.</p>

<p><b>Aseptic Methods.</b> The aseptic method for the treatment
of wounds admits of the use of germicidal solutions
and heat upon the field of operation, upon the hands of the
operator and of his assistants, and upon the instruments
employed. After this has been accomplished, placing absolute
dependence upon this sterilization, no germicidal or
antiseptic substances are brought into contact with the
wound, sterilized salt solution or plain sterilized water being
used, if necessary, to flush the wound, the dressings
employed having been sterilized by dry heat or moist heat.</p>

<p><b>Sterilization of the Hands.</b> Experimental investigation
has shown that the failure of the surgeon&#8217;s efforts to render
his hands absolutely aseptic, has been the productive cause
of infection in many wounds.</p>

<p>The hands and finger nails may be best sterilized by
first rubbing them with spirits of turpentine; then scrubbing
them with soap and water; and then using a sterilized
nail brush freely. The scrubbing should be done for several
minutes. The hands should then be rinsed to remove the
soap, and then soaked for about ten minutes in a solution
of bichloride, strength, 1 to 2500. If turpentine has not
been used before washing with the soap, strong alcohol or
ether should be well rubbed over the hands before they are
immersed in the bichloride solution. Perhaps the best way
of rendering the hands sterile is to scrub them with green
soap and water, then mix a tablespoonful of commercial
chloride of lime and half a tablespoonful of carbonate of
soda with enough water to make a paste. When this has
assumed a thick creamy consistency, it should be rubbed into
the hands until the grains of lime disappear and the skin
feels cool; then rinse the hands in sterile water.</p>

<p><b>Sterilization of Instruments.</b> Instruments may be sterilized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
by boiling them for fifteen minutes in water in which
a tablespoonful of washing soda has been added for each
quart. This prevents rusting of the instruments and also
makes the water a better solvent for any fatty matter which
may be upon the instruments, thus increasing the sterilizing
effect of the heat.</p>

<p><b>Sterilization of the Feet.</b> As most patients do not apply
water as freely or as frequently to the feet as to other portions
of the body, there is usually present an excessive
amount of thickened epidermis, which is very difficult to
render sterile. For operations in chiropody the feet should
be thoroughly moistened with soap and water, scrubbed
vigorously with a brush, then soaked in a solution of bichloride
of mercury of 1 to 1000 strength, and then wrapped
up in a towel soaked in the same solution while waiting for
the operator.</p>

<h3><b>AGENTS EMPLOYED TO SECURE ASEPSIS</b></h3>

<p><b>Bichloride of Mercury</b> is used for the disinfection of
the hands and skin and for the irrigation of wounds.
Biniodid of mercury is extensively employed and in the
same strengths as the bichloride. It is, however, a more
powerful germicide, while being less irritative, and neither
forms a mercuric albuminate nor tarnishes metal instruments.</p>

<p><b>Carbolic Acid.</b> This acid is derived from coal tar, and
although known as early as 1834 as the first antiseptic recommended
and used by Lister, is not so popular since the
discovery that bichloride of mercury possesses more
germicidal action.</p>

<p>Gangrene of the skin and subjacent tissues has often been
traced to the long continued use of dilute solutions of carbolic
acid or of ointments containing small quantities of the
drug. Gangrene of the fingers and toes is by no means infrequent
as a consequence of its use. Another condition
frequently seen is the systemic poisoning through absorption.
One of the first symptoms noticed from such absorption
is irritation of the urinary tract and carboluria. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
poisoning is more apt to take place when the weaker solutions
are used than when the pure acid is used, as the destruction
produced by the pure acid prevents its absorption.</p>

<p>The effect of carbolic acid upon the urine (See Chapter
II, &#8220;<i>Carbolic Acid</i>&#8221;) is to cause it to become smoky a
short time after it is voided. The urine shows a complete
absence or diminution of the sulphates, and albumin is generally
present. When these symptoms present themselves,
the use of carbolic acid should be withdrawn, and the administration
of sulphate of soda and atropin begun. If
the condition has existed for any length of time and the
patient is weak and exhausted, stimulants are indicated.</p>

<p><b>Lysol</b> is a saponified phenol, and possesses some
germicidal power. It is used in strengths of 1 to 3 per cent.
solutions.</p>

<p><b>Creolin</b> is mildly germicidal and is used a great deal in
from 2 to 4 per cent. solutions.</p>

<p>Both lysol and creolin act very much like carbolic acid,
but neither possess its irritating qualities.</p>

<p><b>Formaldehyde Gas</b> is an active germicide and very
valuable as a disinfectant. It is used in the shape of formalin
which is a 4 per cent. solution of the gas in water. This
agent is very irritating to the normal tissues in the stronger
solution, but a 2 per cent. solution of formalin may be used
for the sterilization of the hands, instruments, etc.</p>

<p>The formaldehyde fumes are employed for the disinfection
of clothing, rooms, bedding, and also for the sterilization
of catheters. The fumes of the gas are very irritating
to the mucous membrane and when this agent is used for
the disinfection of rooms, every crevice and crack must be
tightly sealed to prevent the escape of the gas.</p>

<p><b>Iodoform.</b> The action of iodoform is not due directly
to its ability to destroy germs but to its undergoing decomposition
in the presence of moisture, liberating iodin and
thus rendering inert ptomains that have resulted from the
growth.</p>

<p><b>Iodoform Powder</b> is rapidly absorbed by the skin and
fatal cases of iodoform poisoning have occurred from treating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
burns with it. Iodoform is also used in ointment form
and in suppositories. As it is insoluble in water it is commonly
used in a 10 per cent. emulsion. The gauze is also
greatly used.</p>

<p>The symptoms of iodoform poisoning are: delirium;
odor of iodoform on the breath; presence of iodoform in the
urine; eruption over the skin, and finally, coma. Iodoform
is also capable of producing a localized dermatitis, with
great irritation, and must therefore be used with care on
all delicate skins.</p>

<p><b>Aristol</b>, a substitute for iodoform, is a compound of
iodin and thymol, producing no toxic effects and having no
disagreeable odor; it does not, however, possess the
germicidal qualities of iodoform. Nosophen, iodol, and
airol are among the more recent substitutes.</p>

<p><b>Iodin.</b> This drug no doubt possesses more germicidal
properties than was at one time supposed. It is probably
the most powerful antipyogenic known. The 7 per cent.
tincture is the one most frequently used.</p>

<p><b>Acetate of Aluminum</b>, or more properly, aluminium, is
prepared by adding five parts of sugar of lead to a solution
of five parts of alum in 500 parts of distilled water.
Burow&#8217;s solution, see page 35, is chiefly employed as a
wet dressing.</p>

<p><b>Chloride of Zinc</b> in a solution of 15 to 30 grains to the
ounce, has marked antiseptic properties, but it blanches the
tissues when applied to infected wounds.</p>

<p><b>Sulphocarbonate of Zinc</b> is less irritating than the
chloride of zinc and is of the same value as a germicide.</p>

<p><b>Peroxide of Hydrogen</b> when used as a 15 volume mixture
or diluted, seems to have a direct action upon pus
generation by destroying microorganisms of the pus. It is
frequently employed for sterilizing abscess cavities, and for
hastening the separation of necrotic tissue.</p>

<p>This agent has also a marked hemostatic power and is
used to some extent on this account in nose and throat work.
Its hemostatic power is also observed in bone cavities.
Care should be taken never to use it unless there is a free
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
exit, as it increases rapidly in volume after coming in contact
with dead tissue or pus, and serious accidents have
happened from its improper use; for instance, if it is injected
into an abdominal sinus where free escape is not
provided for, the distention will result in ruptures of the
sinus and infiltration of the surrounding tissues; possibly
of the peritoneal cavity. The distention produced by it is
also quite painful and therefore only a small quantity, or a
much diluted solution should be introduced into cavities.</p>

<p><b>Boric Acid</b> is not very actively antiseptic, but even in
a saturated solution it is not irritating. Where bichloride
or carbolic dressings have produced irritation of the skin,
or burns, a boric acid ointment is a very satisfactory substitute.</p>

<p><b>Salicylic Acid</b> is an antiseptic of value. It is generally
used in the form of an ointment. It is but slightly soluble
in water.</p>

<p><b>Potassium Permanganate</b> by its rapid liberation of oxygen,
acts as an antiseptic of proven merit for the disinfection
of foul wounds and ulcers. It is also used satisfactorily
for disinfecting the hands in preparation for operations,
in the form of a 5 per cent. solution, any stain being
removed later by a saturated solution of oxalic acid.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol</b> possesses marked antiseptic properties and is
one of the best agents for the sterilization of the hands of
the surgeon, and for the skin of the patient. A 60 or 75
per cent. solution of alcohol is much more efficacious as a
skin disinfectant than a 95 per cent. solution. This is because
the purer alcohol is much less penetrating than the
dilute. It is also used when diluted with water, one part to
four, as a dressing for granulating wounds. It is efficacious
in limiting the action of carbolic acid, when this agent has
been applied in full strength.</p>

<p>It is a useful agent in which to store certain materials
such as ligatures, sutures, etc.</p>

<p><b>Silver Nitrate</b> possesses undoubted antiseptic properties,
and solutions of varying strengths are decidedly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
antiseptic. These solutions are from 5 grains to the ounce,
to 60 grains to the ounce.</p>

<p>The solid stick of nitrate of silver is used for destroying
exuberant granulations. Among the different silver preparations
on the market, protargol and argyrol are the best
known. Both of these are extensively used in the treatment
of inflammations of the mucous membranes.</p>

<p>The unguentum of Crede, is an ointment of silver which
is used in cases of septic infection and also in localized inflammations.
From 15 to 45 grains of silver can, in this form
be rubbed into the skin. It is absorbed and undoubtedly
exercises an antiseptic influence on the infecting microorganisms.</p>

<p><b>Saline Solution</b>, or normal, or isotonic salt solution, as
it is called because of its close approximation to the blood
serum, consists of a solution of 7 per cent. of sodium chloride
in plain sterilized water. Roughly speaking and for ordinary
purposes, this solution can be made by adding an even
teaspoonful of ordinary table salt to one pint of boiled water
and then reboiling the mixture.</p>

<p>It can be stored for a limited time in sterile glass jars,
which are sealed with sterile cotton. The jars can be heated
to whatever temperature is required for use. This solution
is the one which is generally used for irrigating wounds
and cavities; it is non-irritating and possesses no antiseptic
quality. When a moist dressing is desired there is no solution
comparable to it, largely because of its non-irritating
quality. It has at times a slight irritating effect upon the
kidneys and when large quantities of it are used it is better
to dilute it.</p>

<p><b>Pure Oxygen and Ozone</b> have been used, and the latter
is more effectual. It has been found that oxygen but slightly
retards the growth of bacteria, but both ozone and oxygen
produce a hyperemia, and retard the growth, especially of
anaerobic organisms. Pure oxygen in the abdominal cavity
produces a marked hyperemia and a leukocytosis. Ozone
has been put to some practical use in this country but the
results have not been sufficiently studied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sunlight</b> has a marked retarding effect on some bacteria
and actually destroys them. The anthrax spore is said to
be killed very promptly by exposure to strong sunlight and
it is claimed that the tubercule bacillus is slowly destroyed
by it.</p>

<p><b>Electricity and the X-rays</b> also produce a marked retarding
effect on the propagation of certain microorganisms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><b>INFLAMMATION</b></h3>

<p><b>Definition.</b> Inflammation may be defined as the local
reaction against injurious influences. An aseptic wound
heals without any of the clinical signs of inflammation and
without reaction. It is only by a study of the minute
changes about such a wound that the resemblance, between
the processes of wound repair and those of slight inflammation,
become evident.</p>

<p><b>Etiology.</b> The cause of inflammation is any injury to
the tissues by mechanical, thermal, or chemical means; by
the effect of electricity, or by the growth of bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Pathology.</b> Inflammation occurs through changes in
the circulation.</p>

<p>When one of the causes mentioned above acts upon
the tissues, the first alteration seen is an increasing blood
supply to the part, the arterial circulation being increased
both by the greater rapidity and force of the current through
the vessels, and by the dilatation of all the small branches
and capillaries.</p>

<p>When the inflammation grows more intense, the circulation
in the capillaries becomes slower and the corpuscles
collect, until they clog the vessels. The normal current of
blood in small vessels, as seen under the microscope, shows
a thick central stream of corpuscles with a transparent border
of lymph (containing only a few white corpuscles)
between it and the vessel wall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>As the stream diminishes in rapidity, the number of
white cells in the clear space increases, the blood plaques
appear also, and finally, when the current is reduced to
stagnation, the clear space disappears, being filled entirely
with cells, chiefly leucocytes, although red cells find their
way into it.</p>

<p>This tendency of the white cells to separate from the
others, even when the current is rapid, is partly due to their
viscosity and power of ameboid movement, but in the main
is a purely mechanical effect of the slower current.</p>

<p>It has been proven that when particles of different
density are suspended in a liquid which is circulating
through a system of narrow tubes with a very rapid current,
there is a clear space next to the wall of the tube where the
friction necessarily reduces the speed of the fluid which is
free from particles, and, as the current is slowed down,
some of the particles of least density, begin to appear in
this clear space, their number increasing as the current becomes
slower, until even the heavy particles also collect
here when it is very slow.</p>

<p>It is known that among the cellular elements of the
blood, the leucocytes have the least specific gravity or
density, and the blood plaques rank next, while the red blood
disks are the heaviest, and these bodies appear in the clear
serum near the vessel wall in that order, according to the
law just cited. The slow current is associated with an increased
intravascular blood pressure, which, in part, is the
cause of the phenomena of exudation, emigration and
diapedesis.</p>

<p><b>Exudation.</b> Serum of the blood passes out of the vessels,
and collects in the lymphatic spaces in the cellular
tissue, and elsewhere, and also exudes from the surface of
the mucous membranes or forms vesicles or blisters in the
skin by detaching the superficial epithelial layers. Complete
stasis, or stoppage of the circulation is seen only when the
inflammation is exceedingly intense, and would cause the
death of the part if continued long.</p>

<p>Usually the current merely becomes slower than normal.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
This retarded circulation is followed by the phenomena of
emigration.</p>

<p><b>Emigration.</b> Emigration of the white blood corpuscles
consists in the passage of the cells directly through the vessel
walls. It is most frequently seen in the capillaries, although
it also takes place in the small veins. The white
corpuscles, or leucocytes, have the property of ameboid
movement, stretching out at will in any direction, long, narrow
processes of their protoplasm, called pseudopodia,
which may be attached to any object, and having secured
such an anchorage, the rest of the protoplasmic body is
drawn towards it.</p>

<p>In this way, the leucocytes are able to pass through the
interstices between cells, or along narrow channels in the
tissues. When the blood current becomes sufficiently slow
to enable them to cling to the walls of the vessels, it is then
that ameboid movement begins. Sometimes the cells loose
their hold and are swept on again, but in other cases a
minute bud of protoplasm will appear on the other side
of the wall of the vessel, opposite to the spot where the
leucocyte is clinging, and as this grows larger, a narrow
neck of protoplasm can be traced through the wall directly
to the leucocyte, and presently the mass of the leucocyte
becomes proportionately smaller as the external bud of
protoplasm grows larger. The conditions are gradually
reversed, the nuclei of the cells appear outside and only a
small mass of protoplasm remains within the vessel until
finally the entire leucocyte is in the tissue outside of the
vessel and is free to wander in any direction.</p>

<p>The mechanical part of this process is not yet understood.
It is claimed by some that small openings exist in
the walls of the vessels, between the endothelial cells which
line them, to which is given the name of <i>stomata</i>. These
openings ordinarily are invisible, but they are said to enlarge
under the effect of the dilation of the vessels, and of
the alterations in their walls, produced by the inflammatory
reaction, and that the leucocytes escape through those
openings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the emigration is due to
the ameboid motion of the cell, and the discovery of the
phenomenon, to which is given the name chemotaxis, affords
a sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>This is the influence possessed by certain substances
to attract or repulse ameboid cells. In some cases this
attraction appears purely to be mechanical, but it is probably
a chemical effect of some kind in most, if not in all,
instances.</p>

<p>The process of inflammation produces some chemical
compound which similarly causes the cells to leave the vessels,
and when there is any inflammatory action in their
neighborhood, to find their way by the shortest route to the
seat of the inflammation.</p>

<p>The leucocytes direct their course through the tissues
to the chief points of inflammation by reason of chemotaxis,
and surround the dead tissues, or any point of bacterial
growth, or any foreign body which may be the cause.</p>

<p>The wandering leucocytes form the pus cells, and if they
are very numerous, they constitute a purulent or suppurative
inflammation. The wandering cells, however, are almost
entirely made up of leucocytes, of which three forms
are known, varying in size and in the size and number of
their nuclei. The leucocytes surround any foreign body,
and if the particles are small enough, they incorporate
them within themselves, in fact, they may be said to swallow
them. This taking up of particles by the wandering cells is
called <i>phagocytosis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Diapedesis.</b> When the circulation becomes very low and
the pressure very high, there is a tendency of the red corpuscles
to leave the vessel.</p>

<p>This is a purely passive process, and is observed only
when the changes in the vessel wall are extreme. Both
varieties of these cells die and are destroyed in the exudate,
the former furnishing the fibrin which is so abundant in
some forms of inflammation. This escape of red corpuscles
is known as <i>diapedesis</i>, and is sometimes so extensive as to
amount to capillary hemorrhage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> From antiquity the local symptoms of inflammations
have been enumerated, as heat, redness, pain
and swelling and to these has been added, impaired function.</p>

<p>The <i>redness</i> is due to congestion. The <i>pain</i> is due to
the pressure exerted on the sensory nerves by the surrounding
swelling, as is well shown by the intensification of the
distress, as every beat of the heart forces more blood into
the space already filled. In some cases, however, it may be
caused by the direct action of the inflammatory agent upon
the nerves. The <i>heat</i> is caused by the increased supply of
warm arterial blood, for it has been abundantly proven that
the temperature never rises above the heat of the blood,
although naturally in a patient with fever, it will be above
the normal temperature of that fluid. The <i>swelling</i> is due
to the dilated vessels, and to the escape of serum and blood
cells from the vessels into the tissues. The <i>impaired function</i>
is chiefly caused by the pain which is often increased
by any attempt to use the part, and by the swelling which
prevents free movement, though the loss of function may
also be dependent upon the direct action of inflammation
upon the nerves.</p>

<p>The constitutional symptoms of inflammation are an
elevation of temperature with or without a chill. There
are also other disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, sweating and polyuria. These are due to efforts
on the part of the general economy to eliminate toxic
substances.</p>

<p>The inflammatory products may poison the system in
two ways: (1) by the diffusion of their chemical substances,
(toxins and ptomains), or (2) by the passage of bacteria
themselves into the blood.</p>

<p><b>Termination.</b> Inflammation may result in resolution,
suppuration, necrosis or sloughing, or in the establishment
of a chronic state.</p>

<p><b>Resolution.</b> Resolution is the termination of an inflammation
by the gradual cessation of all the changes which
have occurred. The pain subsides, the circulation becomes
more normal, and the exudate is absorbed, or makes its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
way to the free surface of the body, where drainage occurs
either spontaneously or by incision.</p>

<p>If there has been any loss of substance caused by the
inflammation, it is restored by processes exactly similar in
character to those in the repair of wounds.</p>

<p><b>Suppuration.</b> Pus consists of a serum containing little
or no fibrin and large numbers of leucocytes. There are
also many cells, either dead or dying, which represent the
waste thrown off from the tissues as a result of the inflammatory
reaction. A purulent inflammation or suppurative
inflammation, is one in which there is pus formation.</p>

<p>When suppuration occurs, the pus may make its way
to a free surface, such as a mucous membrane, or may form
an abscess, or may cause sloughing of the skin over the seat
of inflammation, and so escape from the cellular spaces in
the tissues.</p>

<p>Pus may be thrown off by a mucous membrane, without
any actual breach of continuity. Diffuse infiltration of the
tissues is the most dangerous form of suppuration.</p>

<p>In this variety of inflammation the exudate is brought
into contact with the greatest possible extent of absorbent
vessels, for as a surface of a sponge is greater than that
of a bag, which would contain it, so the surface of these
intercellular spaces is much greater than that of an abscess
cavity filled by the same amount of pus. In this form the
bands of cellular tissue, lying between and forming the
boundaries of these spaces, remain intact, and the exudate
is either absorbed into the circulation, or seeks escape
through many punctate openings in the skin.</p>

<p>The entire skin of the part is frequently detached from
the fascia by the sloughing of the subcutaneous tissues,
before it gives way, and even when it finally yields to the
necrotic process, the openings formed will be altogether too
small in proportion to the extent of the disease beneath, so
that healing is still further delayed.</p>

<p><b>Sloughing.</b> Inflammation may be accompanied by
sloughing or death of tissues. Gangrene, mortification or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
necrosis is a death of the tissue from any cause. The part
which has died is designated as a <i>slough</i>.</p>

<p>When inflammation has subsided, granulation tissue
forms on the living tissue, exerting pressure upon the slough,
thus hastening its absorption or separation.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Inflammation.</b> An interruption at some stage
of resolution or suppuration and the continuance of mild
symptoms constitutes a chronic state.</p>

<p>By chronic inflammation, we understand a long continuance
of some or all of the changes seen in acute inflammation,
but less in intensity, and an abnormal tendency to
the production of new tissue.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The general indications to be observed in
the treatment of inflammation are: (1) to combat the congestion
of the parts; (2) to relieve tension; (3) to give free
issue to the products of inflammation; (4) to produce early
separation of sloughs.</p>

<p>Very hot or very cold applications exert a beneficial
and soothing effect upon inflamed areas.</p>

<p>Cold has the tendency to reduce tension by constricting
the blood vessels thus diminishing the amount of blood supplied.
In an infected area the reproduction and development
of bacteria are checked, and suppuration is frequently
aborted.</p>

<p>Heat has the effect of dilating the blood vessels and
hastens repair in bruised, strained, or torn tissues. This
is a variety of hyperemia treatment which is especially
useful in the absence of bacteria. In infected areas the
growth of bacteria, and increased pus formation, would be
encouraged and heat is contraindicated.</p>

<p>We are yet without an antiseptic material which can
be used in sufficient strength to affect the growth of germs
and yet not injure the patient. Injury of the part treated,
and absorption into the circulation are both to be avoided.
The application of dressings, wet with corrosive sublimate,
or other chemical solutions to the unbroken skin over inflamed
areas, is a fallacy. Any benefit which has been observed
to follow their use, has undoubtedly been due to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
effect of the moisture and warmth or cold, according to the
temperature of the dressing, thus obtained, while local
sloughing and general constitutional poisoning are a common
result of such applications. A light gauze dressing,
applied cold, and kept constantly wet with any evaporating
solution, will greatly relieve the congestion and so assist
the inflamed tissues in their contest with any irritating
materials.</p>

<p>A thick wet dressing made with a hot solution, and
well protected against evaporation so that it will retain its
heat, will produce the same effect as a poultice, although
less powerful. When there are discharging wounds or raw
surfaces, unprotected wet gauze should be employed, for
poultices are then inadmissible, and the weak antiseptic solution
will inactivate and wash away bacteria.</p>

<p>Astringent solutions have an excellent effect upon inflammatory
processes and the most generally useful of these
is the 50 per cent. solution of acetate of aluminium.</p>

<p>The following is a modified Burow&#8217;s solution:</p>

<table summary="Burow's solution">
<tr>
<td class="left">Alum</td>
<td class="right">24</td>

<p>Filter after mixture has been allowed to stand for 24
hours.</p>

<p>Ointments are employed by many in the treatment of
small areas of inflammation; they are useful, though not
as efficient as hot or cold wet dressings. Over the unbroken
skin, they can only act like a poultice and should not be
employed where infection exists. On clean wounds they
are unnecessary, but upon ulcers or wounds which show no
tendency to heal, such ointments as Peruvian balsam, 5 per
cent., or scarlet red, 4 per cent., are extremely valuable.</p>

<h3><b>THE PROCESS OF REPAIR</b></h3>

<p><b>Regeneration of Tissues.</b> The reparative powers of
the tissues of the human body are considerable, although
not comparable with those of the lower animals, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
lowest orders of which the reproduction of an entire limb,
or even one-half of the body, may take place. In order to
understand the regeneration of tissue, we must first consider
briefly the life history of the cells.</p>

<p>A cell consists of a mass of protoplasm, generally enclosed
in a cell membrane, and containing a nucleus and
nucleolus. The nucleus represents the most vital part of
the cell protoplasm, and has a more granular appearance
than the latter. The nucleolus is a minute solid spot in a
nucleus, appearing to be more highly refractive.</p>

<p><b>Cell Division.</b> When the cell is quiescent, the protoplasm
appears evenly granular, but when it is stirred to
active life, slender twining threads can be traced in the
nucleus, perhaps consisting of one long thread twisted upon
itself.</p>

<p>On account of their readiness to take up dyes used in
staining, these threads are called <i>chromatine threads</i>.</p>

<p>When the cells are about to divide, the chromatine
threads are seen to arrange themselves in a line across the
center, called the <i>equator</i> of the nucleus, forming a rosette
or star shape, known as the <i>mother star</i>. Some large
granules then appear in the nucleus at points on either side
of this line, which are known as the <i>poles</i> of the nucleus.
The loops of the thread are directed towards the poles.
Gradually these threads become arranged in radiating lines,
converging at the poles, and then break away from their
former connections with the equator, forming a <i>daughter
star</i> at each pole, a clear space appearing at the equator.
A constriction next appears in the now clear equator, and
the nucleus divides into two distinct nuclei. Simultaneously
with this division, or immediately following it, the protoplasm
of the cell body divides in the same place, and thus
two complete cells are produced. The chromatine threads
lose their rosette arrangement, and gradually become imperceptible
as the new cell returns to the quiescent state.
This process of cell division is known as <i>karyokinesis</i> or
<i>aryomitosis</i>.</p>

<p>In simple cells like the leucocytes, reproduction may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
take place by simple fission, thus: a constriction appears in
the nucleus and in the body of the cell in the same line, and
the two divide without any visible protoplasmic changes.
Such a simple mode of division does not occur in the more
highly specialized cells of various tissues. If the karyokinetic
action be not very vigorous, the nucleus may divide,
but the cell body remains intact, producing the cell with
two or more nuclei so commonly observed. Every cell reproduces
its kind, spindle cells producing connective tissue;
epithelial cells epithelium; and bone cells producing
bone.</p>

<p><b>Repair of Wounds and Healing by Apposition.</b> When
a wound occurs, the cut edges immediately retract on account
of the elasticity of the tissues, and the gap fills with
blood and serum. If no bacterial or chemical irritant is
introduced, there are no true inflammatory changes. The
divided blood vessels are soon plugged with coagulated
blood, which extends into the cut vessels to the nearest
branch. The capillaries around the seat of injury dilate
slightly, the fixed cells of the tissues become active, dividing
by karyokinesis as already described. The endothelial cells
lining the divided blood vessels multiply and take an active
part in the process. In spite of the congestion and the new
cells produced, the reaction is much less than that of inflammation.
The new cells invade the blood clot, consuming
it and also any foreign matter, or any tissue which may
have been killed by the injury. From the loops of the occluded
capillaries, at the sides of the wound, spring buds
of endothelial cells, becoming thicker and then hollow as
they extend, blood cells forming in them and blood entering
them also from behind. These advancing endothelial tubes
join with those on the opposite side of the wound, and thus
the new forming tissues are supplied with blood vessels.</p>

<p>It is said that new vessels are also formed by the pre-existing
lymph-spaces and by independent cells. Meantime
the connective tissue cells have been forming fibres across
the clot and epithelial cells over its surface, if skin or
mucous membrane be involved in the injury. The new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
vessels disappear, and the new connective tissue forms the
scar. This is the process of primary union in a wound in
which there is not a marked cavity or a loss of tissue on
any of the exposed surfaces of the body, and no matter how
closely the edges of such a wound may lie in contact, it can
heal by no other method. Even the closest apposition of
the sides of a wound cannot prevent the interposition of a
thin layer of clot and the partial death and absorption of a
very thin layer on its surfaces. This is also known as
primary union.</p>

<p><b>Healing by Granulation.</b> When a wide gap has been
produced by retraction or by actual loss of tissue, healing
takes place by granulation, as it is called, a process which
differs from that just described merely in the fact that more
tissue must be reproduced. The outpouring of blood and
serum, occlusion of the vessels, congestion, multiplication
of fixed cells, emigration of leucocytes, and production of
vascular loops and buds, goes on as before. As the formative
changes advance, small, round elevations of a rosy color
appear on the new surface, making it look like velvet. These
rounded elevations of the healing surface are called granulations.</p>

<p>They advance steadily on all sides, filling the gaping
wound until the level of the original surface is reached, the
new tissue organizing behind them, and contracting as it
organizes, so that the space to be filled is daily made smaller
by this contraction as well as by the production of new
tissue. As the surface is reached, the epithelial cells on the
edges of the granulating area slowly spread over it, the
granulations generally projecting above the adjoining surface
and the epithelium growing over them as they contract
again to their proper level. The advancing line of epidermis
is visible as a pink line, gradually whitening with time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><b>WOUNDS AND CONTUSIONS</b></h3>

<p>A wound is a solution of continuity or division of the
soft tissues produced by cutting, tearing, or compressing
force. The classification of wounds according to their causation
or nature is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Incised</i>&#8212;when resulting from a sharped-edged instrument.</p>

<p><i>Lacerated</i>&#8212;when tissues are extensively torn or
separated.</p>

<p><i>Contused</i>&#8212;when resulting from a more diffused
force, tearing and bruising the tissues.</p>

<p><i>Punctured</i>&#8212;when produced by a narrow instrument
that causes a wound deeper than its external
surface is broad.</p>

<p><i>Poisoned</i>&#8212;when some poisonous substance enters
the wound and causes local infection or constitutional
disturbance.</p>

<p><i>Gunshot</i>&#8212;when the injury results from firearms
or powder explosion.</p></div>

<p><b>An Incised Wound</b> is an injury which is produced by
some sharp instrument such as a knife, pieces of glass or
metal, which divides the tissues cleanly, producing no bruising
or tearing. The pain is usually sharp and burning,
varying with the nature of the instrument with which the
injury has been inflicted. Hemorrhage is usually free.</p>

<p><b>Lacerated Wounds.</b> These usually result from machinery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
accidents or from heavy bodies passing over the
parts and are apt to contain a considerable quantity of
foreign matter ground into the tissues.</p>

<p><b>Contused Wounds.</b> A contused wound is one in which
the edges and surrounding tissues are bruised or crushed.
External bleeding as a rule is not excessive, although there
is a great likelihood of extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage.
Sloughing and gangrene may occur.</p>

<p><b>Punctured Wounds.</b> The character of a punctured
wound depends upon the object producing it. If made by
sharp instruments, such as knives, swords, daggers, bayonets,
or needles, their nature is similar to incised wounds.</p>

<p>Unless organs of importance have been wounded, or
unless active septic material has been carried into the
wound, healing promptly follows after the withdrawal of
the instrument which has caused the wound. These wounds
are usually deep when affecting the dorsal aspect of the
foot, being commonly caused by a falling instrument or tool.
In the plantar region they are of every degree of severity,
from the most minute puncture to perforation running between
interosseus spaces and passing through the dorsal
skin. The most frequent punctures are those caused by
stepping upon needles, pins and tacks. These wounds are,
commonly, of no importance unless the foreign body is
broken off or entirely penetrates the foot.</p>

<p>If the patient is seen a very short time after this has
occurred, the surgeon may operate with some confidence of
finding the offending substance, but even here, if possible,
it is an advantage to obtain an X-ray picture, while in those
cases in which a needle has long been buried in the tissues,
this is quite indispensable. It is well to remember that in
these cases the patients&#8217; impressions us to the location of
the needles are most unreliable.</p>

<p>After a radiograph has been obtained, it is most important,
if anatomically possible, to make the incision at
right angles to the shaft of the needle. At least two pictures
should be taken in order, if possible, to obtain some
idea of the depth at which the needle lies. Even with all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
these helps, the procedure, simple though it may at first
appear, oftens turns out to be one of great difficulty, necessitating
a very extensive operation.</p>

<p><b>Incised Wounds of the Foot.</b> Incised wounds of the
dorsal surface are very frequently quite deep and often
implicate the tendons, bones and articulations, as they are
most frequently inflicted by the fall of some heavy tool upon
the part, or by the inaccurate blow of an axe. Wounds of
slight importance need but the usual thorough cleansing
out, with or without suturing of the skin, according to the
extent of the incision.</p>

<p>If one or more of the tendons have been severed, the
ends should be approximated by catgut sutures. If extensor
tendons are cut in the neighborhood of the metatarsophalangeal
joints, it is often necessary, owing to considerable
retraction of the distal end, to incise the skin down
as far as is needed, in order to secure the retracted end
and suture it. Failure to adopt this procedure permits a
dropping of the toe, converting it often into a regular hammertoe.
When the tendon is properly sutured, the toe must
be placed for some days in a condition of over extension,
most easily secured by a bandage passed under it, acting
like a stirrup, the ends being fastened by several turns above
the ankle.</p>

<p>Incisions, implicating joints, are carefully cleansed by
flushing the joint with copious quantities of saline solution,
and closing the wound with very few stitches. Such injuries
should be examined daily and any sign of sepsis must
be considered as an indication for immediate removal of the
stitches, followed by active antiseptic wet dressings.</p>

<p>Cuts of the plantar surface are not often very extensive.
They are most frequently incurred in stepping upon
some sharp instrument or walking upon glass, especially
while bathing.</p>

<p><b>Contusions.</b> A contusion or bruise is a subcutaneous
laceration, the skin above it being uninjured, as in the abdomen;
or being damaged without a surface breach, as in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
part overlying bone, and blood being effused. If a large
vessel is damaged, hemorrhage is extensive.</p>

<p>An <i>ecchymosis</i> (black and blue area) is diffuse subcutaneous
hemorrhage.</p>

<p>A <i>hematoma</i> is a blood tumor or a circumscribed hemorrhage
in the tissues.</p>

<p>In a diffuse hemorrhage the coagulation of fibrin induces
induration, the serum and leukocytes are absorbed,
the red blood cells disintegrate, and the coloring matter is
widely diffused by the tissue fluids, and hemoglobin is
changed into hematoidin which crystallizes. In union with
these chemical changes, color changes ensue, the part being
at first red and then becoming purple, black, green, lemon
and citron. The stain following a contusion is most marked
in the most dependent area.</p>

<p>A hematoma acts as an irritant, inflammation ensues
around it and it is encapsuled by embryonic tissue, which,
by organizing into fibrous tissue, forms a blood cyst and
gradually absorbs the fluid blood, the cysts contents becoming
thicker and thicker. A fibrous scar may remain, and a
blood clot, with very much indurated surrounding tissue,
giving a hard edge, is noticed after bruises of the periosteum.
If serum is not absorbed, hematoidin forms and
the fluid becomes clear. A hematoma may suppurate, an
abscess forming, but this rarely happens except in drunkards,
although it occasionally occurs in persons who do not
use alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms are tenderness, swelling,
pain, and numbness. The pain may be severe, but rarely
persists beyond the first twenty-four hours. Discoloration
appears quickly in superficial contusions, but only after
days, in deeper ones. Shock and loss of function are present
only after severe contusions. The swelling is first due to
blood and is soon added to by inflammatory exudation.</p>

<p><b>Terminations of Contusions.</b> Slight contusions terminate
promptly by resolution; the more severe may terminate
in gangrene, inflammation, abscess, fibroid thickening,
hypertrophy of the tissues involved, (as in the case of bone),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
chronic inflammations, and even malignant growths, particularly
sarcomata.</p>

<p><b>Prognosis.</b> The prognosis of contusions is a matter of
every day importance, and it is sometimes extremely difficult
to prognosticate accurately. The determining forces
are principally the nature and violence of the contusing
force, the tissues and organs involved, and the general condition
of the patient. Even the injury of the tissues that
may be easily inspected, such as the skin, may be much
more severe than is apparent. In tissues of low vitality,
such as synovial membrane, cartilage and ligaments of a
joint, repair is proportionately delayed, whereas in highly
vascular tissue it is more rapid. Contusions of tissues that
cannot be given physiologic rest, such as the thoracic wall,
and the respiratory muscles, respond less promptly to
treatment.</p>

<p>The general condition of the patient is an important
factor in the prognosis, the most favorable being vigorous
adult life without organic disease. Among the unfavorable
general states are, the extremities of life, the very anemic
and the plethoric, the tuberculous, the syphilitic, the diabetic,
and like diatheses, while in the rheumatic and the
gouty, the slightest injury may be most persistent. The
starved, the overfed, the over-worked, the fatigued, the
alcoholic, and those exposed to extremes of heat and cold,
are unfavorably affected.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Slight bruises, favorably located, require
no treatment. The arrest of hemorrhage, thereby diminishing
the swelling, pain, and discoloration, is important. If
the hemorrhage be from small vessels, elevation, rest, and
the application of ice are sufficient. Frequently the application
of pressure is indicated. Hemorrhage in deeper
parts, such as that occurring under the fascia of the thigh,
is sometimes best controlled by adhesive strapping. If the
vessels are large and the hemorrhage is rapid, it is sometimes
necessary to make a free incision and apply a ligature.
Evaporating lotions or elastic pressure by bandaging over
absorbent cotton, may assist. If the hemorrhage be in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
joint causing immediate swelling, painful from distension,
prompt aspiration will give relief. This should only be
resorted to under the strictest aseptic precautions, as the
conditions are favorable for microbic growth. If the soft
parts are so severely contused as to jeopardize the nutrition,
both bandaging and ice should be withheld, and in some
instances even warm applications are advised. After the
acute symptoms have passed, judicious massage may be
most helpful in securing early resolution. Restoration of
the vasomotor tone when impaired or lost may be greatly
facilitated by douching with cold and hot water alternately
followed by massage. During the acute stages, physiologic
rest is important; the restoration of functional use in severe
cases must be tentative, guided by the response of the tissue
in the form of increased pain or swelling. These phenomena
should be avoided if possible. If hematomata be not absorbed
they should be aspirated and pressure applied before
structural changes take place, such as the formation of a
membrane. If the latter occurs and sufficient time has
elapsed for the formation of definite new tissue, aspiration
may be followed by the obliteration of the sac. Sometimes
hematomata become so thoroughly and firmly organized
and gradually increase in size, that it is extremely difficult
to differentiate them from new growths. If pain and tenderness
persist for a long time, particularly, if there be a
predisposition to tuberculosis, especial care is necessary.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Wounds in General.</b> Arrest hemorrhage,
bring about reaction, remove foreign bodies, asepticize,
drain, coaptate the edges and dress, secure rest to the
part and combat inflammation.</p>

<p>Constitutionally, allay pain, secure sleep, keep up the
nutrition and treat inflammatory conditions.</p>

<p><b>Arrest of Hemorrhage.</b> To arrest hemorrhage the
bleeding point must be controlled by digital pressure until
ready to be grasped with forceps; it is then caught up and
tied with catgut or aseptic silk. Slight hemorrhage stops
spontaneously on exposure to air, and moderate hemorrhage
ceases after the vessels are clamped for a time;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
an injured vessel of some size must be ligated, even if it
has ceased to bleed.</p>

<p>Capillary bleeding is checked by hot water compresses.
In bringing about reaction from shock, raise the feet and
lower the head, unless this position causes cyanosis. At least
place the head flat and the body recumbent. Apply hot
water bottles and hot blankets and give hypodermic injections
of ether, brandy, strychnine, digitalis or atropin, or inhalations
of amyl nitrate. Strychnine can be used in large
doses, one-thirtieth of a grain may be given every ten or
fifteen minutes, until three doses have been taken. If the
skin is very moist, atropin is indicated, alone or combined
with strychnine. Hot coffee, or other hot fluids, should be
given by the mouth and rectum, and mustard should be
placed over the heart, spine and shins. The use of hot and
stimulating rectal enemata is very important. The rectum
may absorb when the stomach refuses to do so. Enemata
of hot normal saline solution are very beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Enteroclysis.</b> The tube is carried into the sigmoid flexure
and the injection is introduced so as to distend the
colon. At times it may be necessary to give an intravenous
injection of saline solution in order to overcome the shock.
In order to prevent the suppression of urine, it may be
necessary to administer diuretics.</p>

<p><b>Removal of Foreign Bodies.</b> Remove with forceps, all
foreign bodies visible to the eye: splinters, bits of glass,
portions of clothing, dirt, etc.</p>

<p>In a lacerated or contused wound, portions of tissue
injured beyond repair should be regarded as foreign bodies
and should be removed with scissors.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning the Wound.</b> If the surface is hairy it must
be shaved before the scrubbing. An accidental wound is
infected and must be well washed out with an antiseptic
solution. A clean wound, made by the surgeon, need not
be irrigated, in fact, irrigation with an antiseptic fluid
leads to necrosis of tissues, causes a profuse flow of serum
and necessitates drainage. If clots have gathered in a
wound, they must be removed, as their presence will prevent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
accurate coaptation of the edges. In an infected
wound, they are washed out with a stream of corrosive
sublimate solution. In a clean wound, they are washed
out with hot salt solution. If dirt is ground into a wound,
as is often seen in crushes, pour sweet oil into the wound,
rub it into the tissues, and scrub the wound with ethereal
soap. The oil entangles the dirt and the soap and water
remove both dirt and oil. After the rough cleansing, irrigate
with corrosive sublimate solution. In some cases,
especially in bone injuries, it is necessary to scrape the
wound with a curet.</p>

<p>A granulating wound is treated the same as an ulcer
and the treatment is discussed under that chapter.</p>

<p><b>Drainage, Closure and Dressing.</b> Superficial wounds
require no special drain, as some exudate will find exit
between the stitches and the rest will be absorbed. A large
or deep wound requires free drainage for at least twenty-four
hours by means of a tube, strands of horse hair, silk,
catgut or gauze. An infected wound must invariably be
drained. Good drainage largely compensates for imperfect
antisepsis. If capillary drains be employed, apply a moist
dressing. Divided nerves and tendons must be sutured.
Close the edges with silk sutures or silkworm gut if the
wound is deep and tension inevitable. Catgut is used for
superficial wounds and for those where tension is slight.
The interrupted suture is, as a rule, the best. If the wound
is infected, dress with antiseptic gauze; with aseptic or antiseptic
gauze if it is not infected. A dry dressing absorbs
wound fluids quickly and is less likely to become infected.
Change the dressings in twenty-four hours or sooner if
they become soaked with the discharge. After this, in an
aseptic wound the dressing need not be changed for days.
If pus forms, open the wound at once.</p>

<p><b>Rest and Constitutional Treatment.</b> In planning the
treatment of wounds the most careful consideration for securing
physiologic rest should be had. If at or near
a joint, the parts both above and below should be immobilized.
In whatever part of the body, physiologic rest should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
be secured as nearly as possible. If the wound be of the
leg or foot, the patient should be in the recumbent position,
with the part elevated and a splint applied. The factor of
rest, next to that of cleansing and dressing, is most important.
Physiologic rest means not only less pain, less
reaction, but a more rapid and certain repair.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances no special constitutional
treatment is necessary beyond that of securing good hygienic
surroundings, easily digested food, restricted at first,
and free action of the bowels. If there is great pain, opiates
may be necessary, but here, as in other surgical indications
for anodynes, a minimum amount should only be given.
Usually rest, elevation, and relief of tension will be of
greater benefit than opiates. If there is great restlessness,
a bromide may suffice; if marked insomnia, one of the ordinary
hypnotics. Great restlessness, with excitement and
occasional delirium, without special evidence of pain or
infective process, must call attention to the possible development
of delirium tremens from a relatively slight injury
(such as a crushed toe or a simple fracture), as it may
precipitate an attack in one who has been a steady drinker,
though perhaps not an excessive one. In such cases, in
addition to the ordinary therapeutic remedies, the regular
administration of whiskey should be advised.</p>

<h3><b>TOXEMIA, SEPTICEMIA, SAPREMIA, PYEMIA</b></h3>

<p><b>Toxemia</b> applies to the diseases in which one or more
poisons are present in the blood which are not necessarily
of parasitic origin and production.</p>

<p>The word poisons is here used in a broad sense to cover
any substance applied to the body, ingested, or developed
within the body which causes disease. It of course includes
ptomains, leukomains, toxins and sepsins.</p>

<p>Toxemia, according to this definition, would include the
diseases due to poisons not arising from parasitic invasion
of the tissues and fluids of the body, at times of vegetable
and alkaloidal nature, such as strychnine or morphine; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
animal origin, such as the toxin of snake venom, the ptomains
of milk or shell fish; then again a mineral such as
arsenic or lead; and lastly the leukomains arising from disturbed
excretion and perverted metabolism and grouped
under such terms as intestinal or uremic poisoning.</p>

<p><b>Septicemia</b> may be defined as an acute febrile affection,
characterized by marked nervous, cutaneous and visceral
manifestations, and due to the introduction into the system
of bacteria and their toxins from an infected wound. It
applies to diseases which present poisons in the blood that
are of parasitic origin, the parasite itself being either
present or absent in the blood. Septicemia, in strong contrast
to the definition of toxemia, would include diseases
arising from the invasion of the tissues and fluids of the
body by animal or vegetable parasites or their poisonous
products.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The onset, as a rule, is slow, beginning
from 4 to 7 days after an injury, with a chill, which is followed
by fever, at first moderate, but soon becoming high.
The fever presents morning remissions and evening exacerbations
and may occasionally show an intermission.
When the remission begins, there is a copious sweat. The
pulse is small, weak, very frequent, and compressible; the
tongue is dry and brown with a red tip; the vomiting is
frequent, and diarrhea is the rule; delirium alternates with
stupor, and coma is usual before death; prostration is very
great, and visceral congestion occurs; the spleen is enlarged,
ecchymoses and petechiae are noted, secretions dry
up, urinary secretion is scanty or is suppressed, and the
wound becomes dry and brown.</p>

<p>Blood examination detects disintegration of red globules
and marked leukocytosis. When a wound becomes
septic, red lines of lymphangitis are seen about it and there
is enlargement of the related lymphatic glands. No thrombi
or emboli exist in septicemia. The prognosis is bad, and in
some malignant cases death occurs within 24 hours.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> is the same as for septic intoxication (see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
&#8220;<i>sapremia</i>&#8221;). Antistreptococci serum can be used, but the
value of this method is doubtful.</p>

<p><b>Sapremia</b> may be defined as an intoxication due to the
absorption of dead saprophytes and their products (ptomains
and toxalbumins).</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The disease sometimes begins with a chill,
followed by a marked rise in the temperature, but in most
cases the latter is the first evidence of the disease. The
skin becomes cold and clammy, there is marked prostration
and sometimes diarrhea. When these manifestations occur
while a wound is present, they are ominous, and the dangerous
complications can be avoided if the dressing of the
wound is renewed and perfect antiseptic precautions are
taken to thoroughly remove all septic matter from its surface.
The constitutional symptoms often disappear of their
own accord, when the above has been done, unless the systemic
intoxication has not already advanced to thwart all
endeavors. There is also a diminution or suppression of
the urine, and a blood examination shows leukocytosis.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment is at once to drain and asepticize
the putrid area and to give large amounts of alcohol.
Strychnine and digitalis are useful. Purge the patient, and
favor diaphoresis, using in some cases the hot bath. Establish
the action of the kidneys; allay vomiting by champagne,
cracked ice, calomel, cocain or bismuth. Give liquid
food every three hours. Feed on milk, milk and lime
water, liquid beef, peptonoids, and other concentrated
foods. Use quinine in stimulant doses. Antipyretics are
useless. Watch for visceral congestion and treat it at once.</p>

<p>The use of saline fluid by hypodermoclysis or by venous
infusion dilutes the poison and stimulates the heart, skin,
and kidneys to activity.</p>

<p>In sapremia the blood contains the toxins and dead
saprophytic organisms. In septicemia the blood contains
both pyogenic toxins and multiplying pyogenic organisms.
In sapremia the causative condition is putrid material
lodged like a foreign body in the tissues. In septic infection
the tissues themselves are suppurating, and both bacteria
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and toxins are absorbed by the lymphatics. Of course,
septic infection may be associated with septic intoxication
or may follow it. The symptoms of sapremia depend upon
the amount of intoxication.</p>

<p>In septic infection, or septicemia, only a small number
of organisms may get into the blood, but they multiply rapidly.
A drop of blood from a man with septic infection will
reproduce the disease when injected into the blood of an animal;
hence it is a true infective disease. The wound in such
a case is often small, and is commonly punctured or lacerated.</p>

<p><b>Pyemia</b> may be defined as a condition in which metastatic
abscesses arise as a result of the existence of pyogenic
bacteria in the circulating blood, either free or contained in
pus cells or thrombi.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms of pyemia are a febrile
movement with a severe chill and a sudden marked rise in
the temperature which lasts for a few hours and passes off
with profuse sweating. The chills recur every other day,
every day, or oftener. The general symptoms of vomiting,
wasting, etc., resemble those of septicemia.</p>

<p>The lodgment of emboli produces symptoms whose nature
depends upon the organ involved. If in the lungs,
there is shortness of breath and cough, with slight physical
signs.</p>

<p>In a suspected case of pyemia, always look for a wound,
and if this does not exist, remember that the infection may
arise from an osteomyelitis.</p>

<p>Chronic pyemia may last for months; acute pyemia
may prove fatal in a few days.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment is the usual supporting one
that should be employed in septic affections, and all suppurating
focci must be opened and drained as soon as detected.
Every branch of the irregular cavities must be
opened and drained at the most dependent part, and the
sinuses must be treated to prevent pocketing. Serum
therapy is also indicated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><b>HEMORRHAGE</b></h3>

<p><b>Definition.</b> The escape of blood from the blood vessels
in great or small quantities, is called hemorrhage, and may
occur either spontaneously or because of injury.</p>

<p><b>Spontaneous hemorrhage</b> occurs in the organs and cavities
of the body as a result of constitutional diseases, such
as tuberculosis, syphilis, cancer, etc., in which erosion of
tissue extends into vessels. It is also a result of a constitutional
tendency. Persons with this, so called hemorrhagic
diathesis, are known as hemophiliacs.</p>

<p>In hemophilia, uncontrollable bleeding may occur from
trifling injuries.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhage due to Injury</b> may be classified as follows:</p>

<div class="container">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Arterial hemorrhage may be recognized by rapid,
spurting jets of red blood, occurring synchronous with the
heart beat.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Venous bleeding (from a vein) occurs as a steady
even stream of dark blood, not affected by the heart beat.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Capillary hemorrhage is in the form of a steady
stream oozing from the raw surface of a tissue. The color
is intermediary, as both arterial and venous capillaries contribute
to it.</p>

<p><b>Nature&#8217;s Efforts to Control Hemorrhage.</b> When an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
artery is severed, the inner and middle coats immediately
retract and curl up within the lumen, partially closing up
the cut end.</p>

<p>Blood has the property of clotting, if it comes in contact
with anything but the natural endothelial lining of the
vessels.</p>

<p>The curling in of the inner and middle coats retards
the escaping stream and facilitates coagulation within the
cut end of the vessel now formed by the outer coat alone.
When the hemorrhage is severe, these processes are reinforced
by an increased tendency to coagulate, and by a
weakened heart action.</p>

<p><b>The Control of Hemorrhage.</b> The object of treatment
in every case is to check the flow of blood, and, though death
from ordinary wounds is rare, yet the loss of much blood is
weakening for a long time.</p>

<p>The principle on which we act in our efforts to permanently
stop bleeding, depends on the power which the blood
has of clotting, or as it is called, coagulating.</p>

<p>If by any means the blood can be made to &#8220;stand still&#8221;
in a blood vessel at the point of injury, it will clot, thus
forming a plug which prevents further escape.</p>

<p>In wounds involving only small veins or capillaries
from which there is no distinct jet of blood (capillary hemorrhage),
pressure of the thumb, a wad of sterile gauze
intervening, will usually suffice in a few minutes. Gauze
dipped in hot water applied to such wounds, also at times
effects a stoppage of such bleeding. Often only tight
bandaging is necessary.</p>

<p>Bleeding from large arteries or veins can be controlled
temporarily by pressure directly over the wound.</p>

<p>Temporary control may also be obtained by digital
pressure above or below the wound, if in a leg or arm,
depending upon whether the escape is chiefly from a vein
or an artery, for in any wound some of the bleeding will
be capillary. This method, or the application of a tourniquet,
will absolutely control bleeding in an extremity.</p>

<p>The pressure in arterial hemorrhage must be applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at a point nearer the heart and in venous hemorrhage at a
point away from the heart.</p>

<p>A tourniquet may be devised from a handkerchief, a
piece of rope or of rubber tubing wound around the limb
and tightened just enough to arrest the main stream; in
addition, pressure exerted over the wound will control
whatever hemorrhage persists. Such a control can only be
temporary, as the arrest of circulation in an extremity
below the tourniquet for more than an hour or two might
cause gangrene. However, there is no great fear of this
occurring, as some blood reaches the parts through deep
vessels.</p>

<p>Permanent control of such hemorrhages can only be
effected by grasping the severed vessels in the open wound
with artery clamps, and then ligating below the clamps with
cat gut.</p>

<p>Deep-seated hemorrhages, in the abdomen or chest, can
often be controlled by pressure directly over the wound until
an open operation can be performed.</p>

<p>Deep pressure, with the fist upon the abdomen just to
the left of the vertebral column, will compress the aorta
and greatly reduce the escape of blood from any artery
supplied by the descending aorta.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhage in Chiropody.</b> For the chiropodist, bleeding
is an annoying and especially perplexing occurrence.
The feet are the most bacteria-laden part of the body; here
are warmth and moisture, congenial to bacteria, and a thick
epidermis for their safe concealment. When hemorrhage
occurs, therefore, its proper control along antiseptic lines
is imperative.</p>

<p>The vessels severed are rarely of sufficient size to cause
the escape of blood in an actual stream, but rather as a
rapid oozing. It is, as a rule, capillary hemorrhage.</p>

<p>The methods for its control have already been described
in this chapter, and will always stop such bleeding.</p>

<p>In chiropodial practice, however, the degree of bleeding
determines the method of treatment, and, though the
extreme may fall short of actual danger, it still behooves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the operator to control it absolutely before dismissing his
patient.</p>

<p><b>Easily Controlled Bleeding.</b> The degree of bleeding or
slight oozing, as it should be termed, incident to skiving a
calloused surface, is well controlled with styptics.</p>

<p>In employing these substances it should be borne in
mind that they are not usually antiseptic but, on the contrary,
may harbor organisms which may be transferred to
the wound and cause infection. The subsulphate of iron,
commonly employed in the form of Monsel&#8217;s solution, is
usually employed because of its efficiency as a styptic, and
because of the fact that it is less irritating than others.
It, however, is not antiseptic and should be kept sterile and
uncontaminated by dropping it upon the wound directly
from the bottle, rather than by dipping the cotton-wound
applicator into it, as is so frequently done. Even this does
not prevent an originally sterile bottle of solution from
becoming contaminated, exposure to the air, when the
stopper is removed, admitting many bacteria each time.</p>

<p>A superior styptic has been supplied in the form of
dry subsulphate of iron fused to small sticks of wood.
These are efficient because of their cleanliness, each being
used but once and at no appreciable expense.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the dressing of even so slight
a wound should prevent the admission of infection to the
thousands of portals of infection which are present. A
bandage is not indicated nor justifiable, and the cotton
collodion cocoon suffices.</p>

<p><b>Persistent Bleeding.</b> When bleeding occurs which does
not yield to the effects of a styptic because of its constant
washing away when applied, it becomes necessary to apply
pressure to the wound. Frequently a wad of cotton or
gauze, pressed firmly upon the bleeding area, will almost
stop the bleeding in a few minutes, after which it becomes
possible to apply the styptic. Should this, however, be
found impossible and the bleeding resume when the pressure
is released, clotting in the vessel can only be expected
by the agency of either ligation of the tissue or any individual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
vessel or more commonly by tight bandaging. The
latter procedure usually accomplishes the control of the
hemorrhage incident to a deep dissection for papilloma or
verucca.</p>

<p>A pad of several thicknesses of sterile gauze is placed
upon the wound and held in place by a few turns of narrow
bandage, applied quite tightly. Though blood may be seen
to &#8220;spot&#8221; through this dressing, it should occasion no
alarm unless the hemorrhage has been clearly either venous
or arterial. Under such circumstances the spurting, either
constant or intermittent, will give immediate evidence of
its character. Active hemorrhage of this nature may yield
to tight bandaging, but ligation of the vessel should be done.</p>

<p><b>Venous or Arterial Bleeding</b> requiring ligation may be
easily dealt with, and every chiropodist should be equipped
with a small artery clamp with which to grasp the tissues;
he should also be provided with sterile catgut, sizes 0 or 00,
with which to ligate a bleeding vessel.</p>

<p><b>Antiseptic Precautions.</b> In dealing with hemorrhage of
even the slightest degree, it should be remembered that
portals of entrance for bacteria upon the feet require every
antiseptic precaution, both as to the treatment of the wound,
and as to the instruments and dressings which come in
contact with it.</p>

<p>For open wounds the U. S. P. tincture of iodin, diluted
in water to one-half strength, is antiseptic and not
extremely irritating.</p>

<p>Instruments dipped in pure phenol and dried on sterile
gauze are rendered sterile and may be safely employed.</p>

<p>Dry sterile gauze in the dressing of a clean surgical
wound is all that is necessary. Healing in the absence of
infection will be prompt. The habitual use of ointments
and wet dressings should be discountenanced, except in the
presence of a real indication.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><b>BURNS, FROST BITE, ETC.</b></h3>

<p>Among the causes of burns are: steam; hot water;
melted glass, wax, rubber, sugar; molten metal; red-hot
metal; gas and flame; burning wood, paper, clothing; electricity;
X-ray; ultra-violet ray; chemicals; acid sulphuric,
trichloracetic acid, common lye; alkalis; carbolic acid;
iodin; croton oil, mustard, cantharides.</p>

<p>From these various causes there is very little difference
in symptoms, course, pathology, and treatment. The
molten lead burns are usually small in area, but of the
third degree. The underlying tissues are often devitalized,
especially around the feet, making a deep, pale, slow-healing
ulcer. The same is true of many burns from electricity.
The effects of X-ray burns are only seen after several days
or weeks and stubbornly resist treatment. Ultra-violet ray
burns may not show any effects at first, but develop symptoms
in about six hours, sometimes accompanied by great
pain. Such burns may be due to sunburn or powerful
electric light.</p>

<p>The epidermis contains no blood vessels, but the mucous
layer has lymph spaces between the cells, draining into the
lymph spaces and channels of the dermis. Nowhere in the
body are nerves more abundant than in the skin. Here we
have nerves of motion to the muscles of the skin; nerves of
pain, temperature, and touch; forming an intricate plexus
of nonmedulated fibres sending their branches upward into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
each papilla, and even to the mucous layer of the epidermis.
Vasomotor nerves supply the coats of most blood vessels
of the skin, and trophic nerves are everywhere controlling
the nutrition of each part. When it is considered what a
complex organ the skin really is; how delicately its parts
are adjusted to the body; how extremely sensitive its nerve
supply, slight stimuli bringing responses and causing reflex
action in far distant organs; how many the uses of the
skin (protection, excretion, expression, and sensation in various
forms), it can readily be understood how great is its importance,
and the far-reaching results of its serious injury.</p>

<p>Burns are classified into three degrees: first, second
and third. In every burn there are two layers of tissue to
be considered: <i>first</i>, the layer destroyed&#8212;the dead flesh;
<i>second</i>, the layer injured&#8212;the sick flesh.</p>

<h3>BURNS OF FIRST DEGREE</h3>

<p><b>Pathology.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Destruction of the cells of the horny layer.</p>

<p>(2) Injury of the cells of the mucous layer with
an excess of lymph. No blistering.</p>

<p>(3) Congestion of the subpapillary plexus with
some destruction of the hemoglobin.</p>

<p>(4) Closing of the ducts of the sweat and oil
glands.</p>

<p>(5) Slight edema of the underlying dermis.</p></div>

<p><b>Clinical Stages.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st stage&#8212;hyperemia and pain.</p>

<p>2nd stage&#8212;edema.</p>

<p>3rd stage&#8212;peeling and staining the skin.</p>

<p>4th stage&#8212;cells of the horny layer replaced by
pushing upward of cells from stratum lucidum.</p></div>

<h3>BURNS OF THE SECOND DEGREE</h3>

<p><b>Pathology.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Destruction of cells of horny layer and sometimes
of the germinal layer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Great exudation of fluid composed of lymph,
fibrin, and broken-down cells in the lymph
spaces of the mucous layer, forming
blisters.</p>

<p>(3) Intense swelling and congestion of the papillary
layer.</p>

<p>(4) Swelling of the connective tissue and elastic
fibres in the true skin.</p>

<p>(5) Thrombosis in some superficial blood vessels.</p>

<p>(6) Leucocytes poured out around the blood vessels.</p></div>

<p><b>Clinical Stages.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Stage of blistering, edema, dermatitis, toxemia,
pain, chill and shock.</p>

<p>(2) Discharge or absorption of contents of the
blister with shedding of dead layers of
epidermis.</p>

<p>(3) Reproduction of cells of the mucous layer
from those of the germinal layer, which
have formed the floor of the blister.</p></div>

<h3>BURNS OF THE THIRD DEGREE</h3>

<p><b>Pathology.</b> Charring of the whole skin through the
reticular layer, or deeper. It may involve only skin, or
include any underlying structures, fascia, muscles, blood
vessels or bone. The essential feature is the total death
of hair follicles, oil and sweat glands, with consequent
destruction of all germinal epithelium.</p>

<p><b>Clinical Stages.</b> (1) Stage of destruction of tissue
with underlying inflammation. If extensive, this degree of
burn causes shock, probably non-toxic. During the early
stage there is apt to be great pain from injury to the nerves
in the sick layer, but not so great as in that of second degree
burns where the number of injured nerves is greater.</p>

<p>(2) The general effects (toxemia, blood changes, embolism,
congestion of vital organs with resultant chill and
shock) are probably little different from those in extensive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
burns of the second degree, as few burns are purely third
degree burns, but if extensive they have also large areas
of second degree burns.</p>

<p>(3) Stage of sloughing. During this stage the second
degree portion of the burn passes through its various stages
and heals. The dead tissue shows at its edges a line of
cleavage from the surrounding living skin. The slough is
usually slow in coming away, owing to the direction of the
connective tissue and elastic fibres which bind it to the underlying
structures. This last stage lasts from one to three
weeks. The process is more rapid in infected burns and
the depth of this burn will depend upon the degree of heat
to which the part was subjected, the length of time the heat
was applied, and several other factors. The danger of infection
is always great owing to: (a) presence of dead
tissue; (b) the low resistance of adjacent sick tissue; (c)
the open veins and lymph channels; (d) the adjoining skin
which is difficult to sterilize; (e) the discharge of a large
amount of serum which forms an excellent culture medium.
There may be also severe hemorrhage as in any sloughing
wound. The danger of this is greatly increased by infection,
which breaks down the thrombi in the veins and
arteries.</p>

<p><b>Stages of Granulation.</b> The cavity left by the slough
rapidly fills with new granulations. These have a tendency
to rise above the surrounding skin.</p>

<p><b>Stage of Epidermis Covering.</b> If skin grafting is not
done, the new epithelium can be renewed only from the
edges&#8212;a slow process often requiring months to cover the
whole surface. Coincident with this stage is the stage of
cicatrization. The granulations which fill the space left by
the slough soon begin to contract&#8212;nature&#8217;s effort to fill the
gap. The granulations are irregular and abundant and for
this reason the scar resulting from a burn is irregular,
uneven, inelastic, contracted, distorted, protuberant and
disfiguring.</p>

<p><b>Duration.</b> First degree burns get well in a few days;
those of second degree, in about from seven to fourteen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
days, and the healing of the third degree burns depends
upon their extent and depth, severe ones requiring a very
long time. As to scarring in a burn of the third degree, you
can always predict it, although this can be minimized by
early skin grafting.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The local treatment is to be directed toward
the limitation of the resulting inflammation; the prevention
of septic infection; assisting the normal elimination
of the eschar; the development of granulations and limitations
of the deformity.</p>

<p>In burns of the first degree little or no treatment may
be requisite; a mild dusting powder such as boric acid or
sodium bicarbonate may be used, or picric acid in the
strength of from half to one per cent.; a 5 per cent. boric
acid ointment is also to be recommended.</p>

<p>Burns of the second and third degree require a different
treatment. Suppose we are called to treat a severe burn
of the second or third degree and find the patient suffering
agonizing pain with oncoming shock and a chill. At once
administer a hypodermic of one quarter to one half a grain
of morphine; 1-40, to 1-20 grain of strychnine; and 1 to
1-100 or 1 to 1-50 grain of atropine. To stop the pain and
combat shock, have the room warm, clear it of unnecessary
furniture; order hot water bottles, and, if necessary, give a
hypodermoclysis or a Murphy enema.</p>

<p>In a severe burn three things are more important than
the local treatment: (1) to stop the pain; (2) to combat
shock; (3) to provide for dilution and elimination of the
toxins, which are thrown into the blood.</p>

<p>After having carried out the instructions given above,
then proceed to do the local dressing. The clothing should
be carefully cut away&#8212;never pulled off, or dragged over
the burned area. A burn is at first sterile, and we must try
to keep it so. Unless we believe that it has become infected
through dirty handling, or by having had dirty clothing
dragged over it, or a dirty blanket laid on it, it is best not
to wash the burn. Pieces of gauze of necessary size are
now spread thickly with an ointment and applied somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
beyond the burned areas; over this cotton, and over all a
bandage.</p>

<p>The patient is now put to bed, and if shock continues,
the normal salt solution is repeated every eight hours and
the patient is given plenty of water to drink.</p>

<p>Nourishment for the first three days should be liquid,
on account of the intense congestion of the alimentary tract
Food is gradually increased according to conditions. There
should be the usual care of the bowels, skin and kidneys,
but in our zeal over the local treatment, we should not forget
that we have to care for a patient whose blood is loaded
with toxins, and whose lungs, stomach, kidneys, and other
organs are congested and filled with emboli. At first, dress
the burns daily, gently wiping away the discharge of serum
and broken down cells, which is poisonous and irritating,
with dry gauze or cotton. Blisters are opened and pieces of
loose skin removed with sterile scissors or forceps, but all
skin is left in place as long as possible to protect the underlying,
new forming skin. Every dressing should be made
with a septic care: clean hands, clean gauze and clean instruments.
As soon as the slough begins to form, if there is
much odor, it is well to apply a continuous wet dressing
(see later reference). In case of a burn caused by carbolic
acid, the skin is neutralized by the use of absolute alcohol
(95 per cent.). In burns from trichloracetic acid, use alkaline
remedies as sat. sol. of sodium bicarbonate. Burns
from caustic alkalies are neutralized by vinegar or by some
other mild acid such as boric acid. A so-called X-ray burn
is not a burn at all; the observable results of such an accident
are not manifested until several days or even several
weeks after the application of the rays, at which period an
inflammatory or a gangrenous process arises, which begins
within the deeper tissues and subsequently involves the surface.
These burns are often accompanied by loss of hair or
of nails in the damaged area; they frequently remain unhealed
for months; if they heal at all, they are very painful,
and are not improved by the treatment which relieves ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
burns. In some cases the consequences are very
serious. Ambrine is a newly proposed remedy.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Cold.</b> The more serious effects consequent
upon exposure to sudden or prolonged cold are termed <i>frost
bite</i>. In this condition the feet are commonly affected, and
very often the freezing is so complete that upon thawing,
the parts are found to be absolutely dead or their vitality so
impaired by the cold that after reaction, strangulation and
inflammation of the tissues occur, producing gangrene. As
in burns there are three degrees of freezing, viz., first, second
and third. In the first, the redness, numbness and tingling
which follow exposure to intense cold are succeeded
by loss of power, usually commencing in the toes, and loss
of sensation, the parts becoming anemic and cold. In the
second degree the skin is red or bluish and is covered by
blebs with clear hemorrhagic contents. If the epidermis
only is lifted up there is quick, scarless healing, but in the
majority of cases the deeper tissues are involved. In frost
bites of the third degree there are blebs and crusts which
eventually mortify. Parts hopelessly frozen are at first
anemic, cold and insensible but after reaction sets in they
become swollen and discolored or they shrivel up and contract.
It is not unusual for the part to show no change for
some days and then to become blue or black; a line of
demarcation forms and the dead tissue sloughs off.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Reaction must be gradual. The room
should be of low temperature; the affected part should be
immersed in ice water; gentle friction or rubbing lightly
with snow is oftimes efficacious. When the temperature is
normal, stimulating friction with soap liniment, alcohol, and
water and spirits of camphor with elevation of the parts, is
advisable. The room may be gradually warmed and the
parts exposed should then be covered with cotton. As
reaction progresses warm, stimulant drinks may be cautiously
administered. If excessive reaction takes place,
evaporating lotions of alcohol and water may be used.
Where a large surface is frozen, prolonged immersion in
a bath may be employed after reaction has been established.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
When gangrene is present, surgical intervention is imperative.</p>

<p><b>Chilblain</b> occurs in individuals with a feeble circulation
or in the anemic or strumous, though healthy young people
are not immune. The feet are very often attacked, especially
the heel and the borders of the feet, but any of the
peripheral parts may be affected. The areas are bluish or
purplish red, swollen, cold to the touch, tender, itching and
burning. Neglect and friction will produce severer grades
of inflammation, with vesicles, bullae, pustules and ulceration
or even gangrene, with or without the formation of
bullae. There may be a favorable termination or fatal septicema
may supervene.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> This should be preventive by protecting
the feet, wearing warm clothing, by exercise, and the administration
of tonics. Local immersion of the affected part
in hot saturated solution of alum relieves the venous congestion
and the itching. In severe cases, heating too rapidly,
or overheating, should be prevented so as not to restore a
too rapid reaction. A strong faradic current, ten minutes
thrice daily, or the electric bath, ten to fifteen minutes daily,
is beneficial. In ordinary cases, balsam of Peru or 10 per
cent. ichthyol ointment, rubbed in, is all that is required.
When there is ulceration, antiseptic dressings should be
applied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><b>FISTULAE; FISSURES; SINUSES; ABSCESSES;
FURUNCLES; ULCERS</b></h3>

<p>A <b>Fistula</b> (pl. fistulae) is an abnormal communication
between the surface and an internal part of the body, or
between two natural cavities or canals. The first form is
seen in a rectal fistula, the second in vesicovaginal fistula.
Fistulae may result from a congenital defect and can arise
from sloughing, traumatism and suppuration. Fistulae are
named from their situation and communication.</p>

<p>A <b>Fissure</b> is a crack and in podiatry, has special reference
to a condition found in the toeweb.</p>

<p>A <b>Sinus</b> is a tortuous track opening usually upon a free
surface and leading down into the cavity of an imperfectly
healed abscess. A sinus may be an unhealed portion of a
wound. Many sinuses may be due to pus, burrowing subcutaneously.
A sinus fails to heal because of the presence
of some irritant fluid (as saliva, urine) or, because of the
existence of some foreign body, as dead bone, a bit of wood,
a bullet, a septic ligature, or because of rigidity of the sinus
wall, which rigidity will not permit collapse. The walls of
a tubercular sinus are lined with a material identical with
the pyogenic membrane of a cold abscess. Sinuses may be
maintained by want of rest (muscular movements) and by
general ill-health.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In treating a fistula, remove any foreign
body; lay the channel open, curet, touch with pure carbolic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
acid, and pack with iodoform gauze. In obstinate cases,
entirely extirpate the fibrous walls; sew the deeper parts
of the wound with buried catgut sutures, and approximate
the skin surfaces with interrupted sutures of silkworm gut.
Fresh air is necessary; nutritious food and tonics must be
ordered.</p>

<p><b>Acute Abscesses.</b> An abscess may be defined as a circumscribed
cavity of new formation, containing pus. An
essential part of this definition is the assertion that the pus
is in a cavity of new formation; is an abnormal cavity;
hence pus in a natural cavity (pleural or synovial) constitutes
a purulent effusion, and not an abscess, unless it is
encysted in these localities by walls formed of inflammatory
tissue.</p>

<p>An acute abscess is due to the deposition and multiplication
of pyogenic bacteria in the tissues or in inflammatory
exudates.</p>

<p>When abscesses form in an internal organ or in some
structure which is not loose like connective tissue, for
instance, in a lymphatic gland, a mass of pyogenic bacteria
floating in the blood or lymph, lodges, and these bacteria, by
means of irritant products, cause coagulation necrosis of
the adjacent tissue and inflammatory exudation around it.
The area of coagulation necrosis becomes filled with white
blood cells, and the dry necrosed part is liquefied by the
cocci. Suppuration in dense structures causes considerable
masses of tissue to die and to be cast off, and these masses
float in the pus.</p>

<p>An abscess heals by the collapse of its walls, and the
formation of an abundance of granulation tissue; in many
cases granulations of one wall join those of the other side,
the entire mass of granulations being converted into fibrous
tissue, and this tissue contracting, heals by third intention.
If the walls do not collapse, the abscess heals by second
intention.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms of an acute abscess may be
divided into (1) local, (2) constitutional. Locally there is
intensification of inflammatory signs; swelling enormously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
increases; the discoloration becomes dusky; the pain
becomes throbbing, and the sense of tension increases; the
cutaneous surface is seen to be polished and edematous, and
after a time, pointing is observed and fluctuation can be
detected. The constitutional symptoms are usually limited
to chills and fever, depending upon the severity of the infection.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> is free incision and drainage. The wound
should be opened early, if possible even before pointing or
fluctuation, to prevent destruction, subfascial burrowing,
and general contamination; drainage is continued until the
discharge becomes scanty, thin and seropurulent.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Abscess</b> is a term referring only to time.
Usually a tubercular abscess is designated as a chronic, cold,
or scrofulous abscess. It is an area of disease produced
by the action of the tubercular bacilli and is circumscribed
by a distinct membrane. The symptoms present no inflammatory
signs. Constitutional symptoms are trivial or
absent unless secondary infection occurs. The treatment of
these cold abscesses depends upon their location.</p>

<p><b>A Furuncle or Boil</b> is an acute and circumscribed inflammation
of the deep layer of the skin and the subcutaneous
cellular tissue, following on bacterial infection of the hair
follicle through a slight wound (by scratching, shaving),
with the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms of a boil are as follows:
a red elevation appears, which stings and itches; this elevation
enlarges and becomes dusky in color, a pustule forms
that ruptures and gives out a very little discharge which
forms a crust; inflammatory infiltration of adjacent connective
tissue advances rapidly, and the boil in about three
days consists of a large red, tender, and painful base, capped
by a pustule and some crusted discharge. In rare instances,
at this stage, absorption occurs, but in most cases the swelling
increases, the discoloration becomes dusky, the skin
becomes edematous, the pain severe, and the centre of the
boil becomes raised. About the seventh day rupture occurs,
pus runs out, and a core of necrosed tissue is found in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
centre of a ragged opening. The hair follicle and the
sebaceous gland, which have undergone necrosis, are found
in this core. Healing by granulation will occur; the constitution
often shows reaction during the progress of a boil.</p>

<p>Boils may be either single or multiple, and the development
of one boil after another, or the formation of several
boils at once, is known as <i>furunculosis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment consists of crucial incision
and the application of a wet dressing.</p>

<p><b>An Ulcer</b> may be defined as the loss of substance due
to necrosis of a superficial structure, and the causes of
ulcers may be divided into (1) predisposing and (2) exciting.
In the former, age, sex, occupation and social condition have
to be considered. The exciting causes are traumatism and
infection.</p>

<p>The chief varieties of ulcers seen on the leg and foot are
as follows: indolent or callous; varicose; tubercular; syphilitic;
epitheliomatous; diabetic; perforating and blastomycotic</p>

<p>In indolent or callous ulcer, the cause may be divided
into general and local. Among the former may be mentioned
typhoid fever, chronic nephritis, anemia, poor
hygiene, improper food, overwork, and lack of sleep. Local
causes: old scar tissue, extremes of heat or cold, irritation
of the tissues, injury, the presence of a foreign body such
as dead bone, splinter, etc.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The most common location of these callous
ulcers is on the inner side of the lower third of the leg. They
show a great variety in size, shape, appearance and base,
edges and surrounding area, and in accordance with these
differences, many different names are applied to them. The
size varies from a small ulcer less than one centimeter in
diameter, sometimes found with varicose veins, to the large
ulcerations which surround the leg and are called <i>annular</i>
ulcers. The shape may be round, very irregular, or funnel
shaped. The base may be much or slightly depressed, or
the granulations may be at a higher level than the surrounding
edges. When the granulations are large, irregular,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and bleed easily, they are spoken of as <i>exuberant</i>; when
pale, soft and flabby, as <i>weak</i> or <i>edematous</i>; when small and
slowly growing, as <i>indolent</i>.</p>

<p>A peculiarly painful form of chronic ulcer is found
over the internal malleolus, and most frequently in women
of middle age; it is often associated with menstrual disorders
and is known as a <i>congested</i> or <i>irritable</i> ulcer. It
begins as a small area of congestion over the internal
malleolus, which gradually increases in size and becomes
dark and more dusky in the centre, due to the deposit of
blood pigment caused by chronic congestion. The skin
next becomes hard, dry, scaly and pigmented, while the
subcutaneous tissues lose their elasticity, becoming inflexible,
hard and adherent to the deeper structures. Then,
as a result of slight traumatism or even without injury,
the centre of the area breaks down and an ulcer develops.
It may be circular or irregular in shape and may be quite
deep or superficial. The edges are sharply cut, and both
base and edges are bound down to the deeper tissues. The
intense pain of the ulcers is supposed to be due to pressure
upon the terminal nerve filaments in the dense sclerotic
tissue. This form of ulcer is very often difficult to cure and
shows a tendency to return after healing.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> This naturally depends upon the time the
ulcer is seen and the conditions present. If there is considerable
inflammation, accompanied by marked cellulitis
and pain, the milder wet dressings, such as boric acid or
Thiersch are indicated. Rest, of course, is the most important
factor. The patient must be prohibited from walking,
and if necessary, the movements of the neighboring joints
must be prevented by the application of suitable splints.
After the acute inflammatory symptoms have subsided the
granulations must be stimulated, (see Chapter XIX).</p>

<p><b>Varicose Ulcer.</b> To chronic ulcers of the leg associated
with varicose veins, especially of the smaller venous
radicles, the name varicose ulcer has been given.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The usual development of this variety of
ulcer is as follows: persons who suffer from varices of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
leg usually complain for some time before the external
manifestation of the disease, of a deep aching pain in the
limb, with a sense of weight, fullness, and fatigue. In a
more advanced state of the disease, the ankles swell after
a day&#8217;s hard work, and the feet are constantly cold; an
embarrassed state of the circulation is denoted by these
symptoms and the deep seated veins begin to swell. After
a time, which varies with the idiosyncrasy and occupation
of the patient, small soft, blue tumors are seen at different
points of the leg, most of them disappearing on pressure,
but returning when this pressure is removed or when the
patient stands up. Each little tumor is caused by a vein
dilated at the point at which it is joined by the intramuscular
branch. Around many of these tumors a number
of minor vessels of a dark purple color are clustered, these
being the small superficial veins which enter the dilating
vein and in which the varicose ulcer is often of a brownish
blue color, due to a deposit of pigment. Frequently a leg,
which is the seat of varicose veins, or which is edematous
from other causes, is attacked by acute eczema. The
recognition of varicose ulcers is usually easy but the mere
presence of enlarged veins, it should be noted, is not pathognomonic,
because they may often exist along with ulcers
of other origins, tuberculous, syphilitic, etc.</p>

<p>The surface of varicose ulcers usually presents imperfect
and unhealthy granulations, secreting a more or less
thin and offensive pus, and the granulations are sometimes
covered with membranous exudation. The edges and base
are thickened and callous, and enlarged veins, capillary or
otherwise, are present near the circumference and often
amount to genuine blood tissue which tunnels the infiltrated
tissues. In examining such an ulcer one gets the impression
of a great pigmented scar, the centre of which has broken
down.</p>

<p>Lymphangitis and venous thrombosis are not of infrequent
occurrence in connection with varicose ulcers, while
embolism and even pyemia are sometimes in evidence.
Among the most frequent complications is cellulitis, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
this may sometimes be so severe as to necessitate operation.
Erysipelas may also occur in cases of varicose ulcer, and
hemorrhage is a common and serious complication and has
at times been fatal.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment of varicose ulcers must be
based on antiseptic cleanliness, and the improvement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
nutrition by improvement of the circulation of the blood
and lymph. Then again the treatment will vary according
to the time when the ulcer is first seen by the surgeon. In
aggravated ulcers, especially those accompanied by crusts,
foul smelling discharges and various inflammatory conditions,
the leg should be washed once or twice daily with
soap and water, cleansed with a piece of sterile gauze, and
shaved when necessary. Warm applications should be employed
such as Wright&#8217;s solution, boric acid; Thiersch and
the stronger antiseptics are uncalled for, as they often induce
eczema. Under such treatment, in most cases, the
swelling and irritation will subside and the ulcer will become
clean and more healthy in appearance, especially if the
patient be confined to bed with elevation of the limb. Rest
always seems to the patient a useless waste of time, but in
reality time is thus saved. It is by far the most important
point in the treatment of ulcers of the leg in which poor circulation
is a factor, but the plan must be carried out consistently
in order to obtain the best results. The condition
does not admit of occasionally walking about the house or
of sitting in a chair. However, when circumstances do not
permit of the recumbent position, the veins can be supported
in various ways. Bandages of plain rubber, or rubber
cloth, or cloth woven and rendered elastic by the character
of mesh, or elastic stockings, or flannel, gauze, or muslin
bandages, can be used. It is preferable to use flannel
bandage (see Therapeutic measures) for the reasons mentioned.
The best means of obtaining the support, however,
is by the use of Unna&#8217;s Paste. The technic and application
of this method of treatment has also been described (Therapeutic
measures).</p>

<p>Operations upon varicose veins are frequently called
for in aggravated cases, provided the general condition of
the patient permits. Briefly, these many consist in multiple
ligations, in ligation of the internal saphenous alone, in
extirpations of large or small sections of varices, in circumcision
of the skin above the ulcer, or of the ulcer itself,
tying all the veins and reuniting the cuticle. However, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
must not be forgotten that in the presence of an ulcer,
infection of an operative wound is likely to occur.</p>

<p><b>Syphilitic Ulcers</b> may result from pustules or they may
begin as tertiary sores. They occur frequently where the
integument is thin or where the part is kept moist by the
natural secretions. The deep ulcers of tertiary syphilis
develop from gummata. These are variously sized deposits
largely made up of large spheroidal cells and a few giant
cells. They are poorly supplied with blood vessels and
undergo coagulation necrosis, but do not tend to suppurate
until infected. Sooner or later the overlying skin becomes
involved, either with or without a pyogenic infection, and
the gumma sloughs out leaving the typical syphilitic ulcer.
A protozoa microbe (Schaudinn&#8217;s and Hoffmann&#8217;s organism)
is now the recognized cause of syphilis. It is called the
<i>spirochaeta pallida</i> or <i>treponema pallidum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> When a syphilitic ulcer develops it usually
assumes one of two types, superficial or deep. The former
may appear comparatively early in the disease. It usually
varies in size from a quarter to a half dollar piece, has a
circular outline, sharply cut, indurated edges, and a dirty
greenish base. The deep ulcers result from the breaking
down of gummata. They are, at the beginning, surrounded
by a reddened area of inflammation, the small ones being
crater like, with punched out edges, the larger ones having
overhanging, thin, soft, inflamed edges. The base is
indurated, of a dusty red color and dirty or sloughing in
appearance, the slough being often of a greenish color. The
discharge is thin, frequently bloody, and contains debris
from the broken down gumma. The surrounding skin is
indurated, of a dusky red color and dirty or sloughing in
for some time, they loose their characteristic appearance
and take on the form of simple chronic ulcers. The scar
remaining is characteristic. It is thin, of a dead white
color, pigmented here and there, and when pinched it
wrinkles like tissue paper. Thin form of syphilitic ulcer
is found most frequently on the upper third of the leg.
When ulcers are accompanied by enlarged veins, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
extremely difficult at times to make a differential diagnosis
between a luetic ulcer and one of a varicose type. The chief
differential points are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Location</i>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varicose ulcers, the lower third of the leg.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syphilitic ulcers, the middle and upper third of
the leg.</p>

<p><i>Appearance</i>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varicose, irregular, not undermined, granulations
reddish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syphilitic, typical punched out edges, sharp, and
undermined, greyish discharge, thin and watery.</p>

<p><i>Number</i>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varicose usually single.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syphilitic, multiple, having a tendency to
coalesce and form one large ulcer.</p></div>

<p>A very important point to remember is that a syphilitic
ulcer, once healed, usually remains so. At times it is
extremely difficult, even in view of the different points
already mentioned, to make a distinct diagnosis between a
varicose and a syphilitic ulcer; then the Wasserman reaction
should be resorted to, but too much stress should not
be placed upon its findings. It may happen that a patient
having a suspected luetic ulcer is given mercurial treatment
with the result that the reaction is negative, but this should
not exclude the possibility of syphilis existing. A positive
Wasserman in a case of chronic ulcer with enlarged veins
which refuses to heal, warrants a diagnosis of a syphilitic
lesion. In a great many cases the Noguchi luetin skin
reaction is of great aid in establishing a diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment is both local and general.
As regards local treatment, if the ulcer secretes freely,
either the black wash or a solution of bichloride, varying
from 1 to 5000 to 1 to 10000 should be employed. Where
there is very little discharge, calomel powder is indicated.
In addition, it is understood that a firm compression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
bandage be applied (especially in those cases complicated
with enlarged veins) beginning at the base of the toes and
carried up to the knee.</p>

<p>The general treatment consists of the intravenous
injection of salvarsan or neosalvarsan (10 grains), or the
intramuscular injection of bichloride of mercury, one
quarter of a grain, or 10 minims of a 10 per cent. suspension
of salicylate of mercury. In addition, mercurial rubs and
the administration of iodides and mercury internally are
advised.</p>

<p><b>A Tuberculous Ulcer</b> usually results from the bursting
through the skin of a tuberculous abscess. The base is,
soft, pale and covered with feeble granulations, and gray
shreddy sloughs. The edges are of a dull blue or purple color
and gradually thin out toward their free margins, and in
addition, are characteristically undermined, so that a probe
can be passed for some distance between the floor of the
ulcer and the thinned out borders. At times the edges are
solid and puckered, being scarlike in character. Thin,
devitalized tags of skin often stretch from side to side of
the ulcer. The outline is irregular, small perforations often
occur through the skin and a thin watery discharge containing
shreds of tuberculous debris escapes. The ulcer is
usually superficial and very little pain is present. At times
it is crusted over, the crust being thin and of a brown or
black color. Again it may be progressing at one point and
healing at another. It is slow in advancing but often proves
very destructive. The scars left by its healing are firm
and corrugated, but are apt to break down.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The local treatment calls for special mention.
If the ulcer is of limited extent, the most satisfactory
method is complete removal by means of the knife, scissors,
or sharp spoon, of the ulcerated surface and of all of the
infected area around it, so as to leave a healthy surface
from which granulations may spring. If the raw surface
left is likely to result in cicatricial contraction, skin grafting
should be employed.</p>

<p>The general treatment should consist of tonics, plenty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of fresh air, and a good nutritious diet. Bowels must be
regulated.</p>

<p><b>Perforating Ulcer of the Foot</b> occurs in connection with
lowered resisting powers of the tissues, due usually to some
lesion of the nerves or vessels. The ulcer is circular in
shape, painless, with callous borders, and eats progressively
into the deeper tissues and bones, and has little or no
tendency to heal.</p>

<p><b>Etiology.</b> Although formerly looked upon as a specific
disease, perforating ulcer is now known to depend upon
many local and general conditions of which it is occasionally
a more or less accidental manifestation. The
various theories as to its immediate causation may be
divided into: (1) mechanical, (2) vascular, (3) nervous,
(4) mixed.</p>

<p><b>The Mechanical Theory</b> regards injury as the sole
cause, due in most instances to the pressure or rubbing of
a shoe. If this explanation were adequate, however, such
ulcers would be extremely common, while in reality they
are rare.</p>

<p><b>The Vascular</b> theory assumes that arteriosclerosis is
always present, and causes ischemic necrosis through
arterial and capillary thrombosis.</p>

<p><b>The Nerve</b> theory, which is the one most commonly
accepted, is that perforating ulcer is always of trophic
origin and depends upon a chronic peripheral neuritis. In
support of this assertion, attention is called to certain interstitial
and parenchymatous alterations frequently demonstrable
in the nerves of the affected part. It must not be
forgotten, however, that these nerve changes may be due
to secondary disturbances in nutrition, depending upon
arteriosclerosis as in senile, diabetic, and other forms of
gangrene.</p>

<p><b>According to the Mixed Theory</b> either vessels or nerves,
or both may be at fault. It admits that traumatism is an
important factor, although seldom if ever an exclusive
cause. Perforating ulcer is observed in connection with
various diseases and conditions, the most prominent of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
which are locomotor ataxia, fractures of the spine, injuries
of the cord, diabetes, spina bifida, syringomyelitis and
injury and division of the peripheral nerves. Perforating
ulcer from lesions of the central nervous system is comparatively
rare and it is doubtful if it is ever due to
embolism or to ligation of the arteries.</p>

<p>The three most prominent causes, therefore are, (1)
affections of the spinal cord (2) injuries of the peripheral
nerves and (3) diabetes.</p>

<p>This variety of ulcer is seen more frequently in males
than in females, and it is almost exclusively confined to
adults, especially between the ages of forty and sixty. Occupations
requiring standing or walking are strong predisposing
causes, provided a tendency to the disease exists. A
poor fitting shoe and deformities of the foot giving rise to
excessive pressure or irritation, are of much importance in
determining the appearance and location of the ulcer. It
rarely appears in children, unless it is associated with spina
bifida.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> Perforating ulcer has a marked tendency
to develop where pressure and irritation are greatest, which
is almost always upon the sole of the foot at the junction
of the great or little toe with the metatarsus. It may occur,
however, upon the heel, the sides of the foot, the plantar
surface of any portion of the great toe, or even upon the
centre of the sole, these unusual situations being most commonly
found associated with diabetes. When talipes or
hammertoe exists, the ulcer is apt to occur wherever pressure
is pronounced, even upon the dorsum of the foot or
the ends of the toes. Usually but one foot is affected,
although both feet may be involved, in which case the disease
is termed symmetrical.</p>

<p>Three stages may be recognized in the development of
the ulcer: (1) the formation of callosities, (2) superficial
ulceration, (3) deep ulceration. Very frequently in tabes
and in diabetes, a purulent blister is the first indication of
trouble, but usually a marked epithelial thickening, in the
form of a corn or a bunion, is the initial symptom. Sooner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
or later the centre of a callosity breaks down into a bluish,
unhealthy, indolent, superficial ulcer, secreting a small
quantity of watery pus, and with an offensive odor. The
sore is circular as though punched out of the callous tissue,
the latter at times so thickened and overhanging that the
ulcer is almost concealed beneath it. There is little or no
tendency to heal, even under exacting treatment, and if
recovery should take place, a speedy relapse is the rule,
even with the patient remaining in bed. The indolent and
foul ulcer tends to eat deeply into the adjacent tissues,
progressively involving bursae, tendons, muscles, joints,
and bones. A deep round hole results, which may even
perforate the foot. The most striking symptoms are
chronicity, stubborn resistance to treatment, and the
absence of pain and tenderness.</p>

<p>The fact that perforating ulcer is so often found in
connection with lesions of the nervous system accounts for
the abnormalities of sensation, motion and reflexes which
accompany it. This explains the various trophic disturbances
which are very often observed, such as epithelial
growth, not only in the vicinity of the ulcer, but occasionally
over the entire foot and leg; also eczema, erythema
and excessive perspiration. The nails are frequently
thickened and distorted and the subcutaneous cellular
tissues are so changed as even to suggest elephantiasis.
Inflammatory complications, sometimes serious, are not
uncommon owing to infection through the ulcer, and an
ascending neuritis may even result in myelitis. Gangrene
from arteriosclerosis is also frequently seen.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> in those predisposed to diabetes and tabes,
deserves prophylaxis consideration. The shoes must fit
accurately and without undue pressure; much walking is
to be avoided; when ulceration has begun the recumbent
position and cleanliness are of paramount importance. The
callous epidermis should be removed so as to render the
ulcer as superficial as possible. Dead bone must be scraped
away or extracted, if in the form of a sequestrum, and
drainage must be perfected by enlarging the opening.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Sinuses should be enlarged and any pockets found should
be thoroughly opened. It must be emphasized, however,
that operative interference should be undertaken with care
and discretion in order to avoid necrosis and infection. Periodic
curettments and cauterizations with silver nitrate are
often of benefit, as are also the employment of dry iodoform
gauze as a packing, together with the occasional use of
various moist dressings. Both the constant and interrupted
currents of electricity have been resorted to with benefit,
sometimes locally and sometimes applied to the spinal cord
or affected nerves. Measures directed to the improvement
of the circulation of the foot, such as massage, stimulating
baths, and lotions, are of service.</p>

<p><i>Bier&#8217;s Arterial Hyperemia</i>, in the form of baking of the
foot by means of a gas or electric apparatus, especially
devised for the purpose (Tyrnauer) is of great benefit,
more so when there is a neuritis accompanying the ulcer.
The baking should be done once a day for from ten to
twenty minutes, and the temperature should be gradually
increased from 100&deg;F. to 300&deg;F., depending upon the
patient&#8217;s ability to tolerate heat.</p>

<p>The passive, venous or obstructive form of hyperemia
is absolutely contraindicated in this class of ulcers. The
initial cause of the trouble must receive attention, because
upon its successful management depends the cure, much
more so than upon the local measures.</p>

<p>Diabetics and syphilitics should receive appropriate
treatment. The bad cases, especially where gangrene or
serious infection exists, may require amputation, but unless
this can be done in sound tissue with adequate innervation,
a perforating ulcer may develop upon the area exposed to
the pressure of an artificial limb. Resection of joints is
usually of little benefit. The most satisfactory operative
results in this class of ulcers have been obtained by stretching
the posterior tibial nerve, together with scraping the
ulcer, or, better, by excising it, followed by immediate
suture of the wound. The operation is best done through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a curved incision beneath the internal malleolus, the nerve
being isolated and vigorously stretched in both directions
by means of some blunt instrument inserted beneath it.
Sometimes the external or internal plantar nerve alone is
treated in this manner.</p>

<p><b>Blastomycotic Ulcer.</b> This is not a common condition
in the lower extremity. It is found near the lower third
of the leg, and begins as a papule or papulo-pustule, soon
becoming covered with a crust which, on removal, discloses
a papillomatous area. The typical ulcer is elevated,
verrucous or fungating, with a soft base which is infiltrated
with a seropurulent secretion. The border is dark-red or
purple and slopes more or less abruptly through the normal
skin, from which it is sharply defined. The quickest and
most positive method of differentiation is by means of the
tissues. The organisms are fungi, known as the blastomycetes,
saccharomyces or yeasts, characterized especially by
their mode of multiplication or cell division, called budding.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In all cases, thorough cleansing of the ulcer
with antiseptic lotions, as previously described, is of great
benefit. Complete extirpation of the ulcerative lesions has
been successful, but curetting does not always prevent their
recurrence. Potassium or sodium iodide in large doses
(totaling from 100 to 400 grains per day) and radiotherapy
seem to be the most efficacious forum of treatment. Copper
sulphate in a 1 per cent. solution as a wash for external use
and also in one quarter of a grain doses internally, has in
some cases given good results.</p>

<p><b>Epitheliomatous Ulcer.</b> In none of the more common
ulcerative skin lesions would the conditions for the development
of cancer seem to be more favorable than in chronic
dermatitis with ulceration; the despised and neglected
varicose ulcers of the leg. The extreme chronicity of the
inflammatory process, often lasting for many years; the
age of the patient, which is usually advanced; the almost
inconceivable neglect of the lesion in many cases, so that
the persistent presence of foul and decomposing secretion
and of the products of tissue necrosis is common: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
frequent absence of even an attempt at cure; the fact that
most of these patients are compelled to be on their feet all
day and thus keep up and increase the unfavorable conditions;
and, finally the circumstance that in many of them
the added history of alcoholism, of renal or cardiac disabilities,
or of other chronic affections is also present; all of
these factors would lead to the presumption that in this
ulcerative lesion, above all others, carcinomatous degeneration
would be the most common.</p>

<p>While so few instances of cancer secondary to varicose
ulceration are seen, it rarely appears before the age of
forty. It is usually seen where varicose ulcers as well as
the scars they produce are found. The base of the characteristic
ulcer is hard, nodular and irregular, made up of
firm warty granulations, and often covered with sloughs.
It bleeds easily and has a foul discharge. The edges are
hard and everted. The borders and base present a peculiar
and striking thickness and hardness, as though the ulcer
were imbedded in cartilage, while the granulations feel
firm and appear red and warty. The amount of pain, the
involvement of neighboring lymphatic glands and the rate
of growth vary. Epitheliomata which have developed from
congenital warts, moles, or nevi are apt to be very
malignant. When epitheliomatous degeneration occurs in a
chronic ulcer, it first begins to get hard about the edges,
which become everted and gradually bound down to the
deeper tissues. The granulations about the margins become
large, red, nodular, hard and bleed very readily. This
condition spreads over the entire ulcer, which assumes a
sloughing and foul character. The diagnosis is confirmed
by the microscopic examination of a section cut from the
edge of the ulcer.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Malignant ulcer can be cured only by the
destruction or removal of the new growth. For its treatment,
caustics with or without curetting, excision or
radiotherapy may be employed. The best caustics are
arsenic, chloride of zinc, caustic potash and formalin.</p>

<p>The objections to this method are the extreme pain;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the lack of certainty as to the removal of all of the
neoplasm; the fact that the lymphatics and glands are not
dealt with, as well as the fact that unless the treatment is
thorough, the growth is stimulated rather than retarded.
The scar is also apt to be unsightly. Without doubt excision
forms the best method of treatment. The incision should
be wide of the ulcer, and all indurated tissues and any
lymphatics or glands that are involved must be removed.</p>

<p>In some cases it may be necessary even to amputate the
leg in order to effect a cure. The X-rays from the Coolidge
tube are to be recommended, as the cross fire effect
of these rays in some cases is of great benefit. Recently
radium has been used in these ulcers of the leg with good
results. The gamma rays are to be preferred as they are
more penetrating and should be applied two or three hours
a day for a number of days. At least from 50 to 200
milligrams of radium bromide must be used in order to
obtain any effect. Recently beta rays have been found to
be as effective as the gamma rays. In order to prevent a
radium burn the rays have to be filtered before they are
applied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><b>DISEASES OF JOINTS&#8212;THE SEROUS
AND SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES</b></h3>

<p>The moist glistening membrane lining the abdomen
(<i>peritoneum</i>) and that lining the chest (<i>pleura</i>) are similar
to the synovial sac between the bone ends at joints or the
synovial sheaths of tendons.</p>

<p><b>Bursae.</b> A bursa, which is a sac lined with serous membrane,
placed over a joint or other prominent part for
protection, is also quite similar. All of these membranes
are smooth and moist, giving lubrication to movable parts,
thus: the peritoneum covering the intestines, permits of
their easy worm-like action within the abdomen; the pleura
makes for the free rise and fall of the lungs; the <i>synovial
sacs</i> of joints allow the bones to ride smoothly one upon the
other; the <i>synovial sheath</i> of a tendon acts like a silken
sleeve in which the tendon slides up and down and, lastly,
pressure over a bony point causes the member to move
aside because of the slipping of the walls of the bursa, one
upon the other, when compressed.</p>

<h3><b>INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BURSAE.</b></h3>

<p><i>Synovial bursae</i> exist normally in connection with tendons
or with certain joints, and may be developed by continued
friction or pressure at certain parts of the body.
Deep bursae are sometimes connected with the joints, or
are in very close relation with them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Injuries of Bursae.</b> Wounds of bursae may be either
contused, incised, lacerated, or punctured, and, if they
become infected, may prove most serious injuries. Wounds
of bursae should be thoroughly disinfected and drained;
they usually heal with obliteration of the sac.</p>

<p><b>Acute Bursitis.</b> This affection usually results from an
injury or from continuous irritation of a bursa, and is
characterized by tenderness, pain, redness of the skin, and
swelling or distension of the bursa. If suppuration occurs,
the inflammation is apt to extend to the surrounding
cellular tissue, or, if in close proximity to a joint, the latter
may be involved. Bursitis can usually be diagnosed from
other affections by the rapidity of development of the
inflammatory symptoms, the location of the swelling in relation
to certain tendons or joints, and its globular shape.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> This consists in elevating the part and putting
it at rest on a splint, and in the application of cold
or pressure. If, however, the pain and swelling due to
effusion continue, and there is evidence of suppuration, the
bursa should be freely opened and irrigated, and subsequently
packed with sterilized or iodoform gauze. Under
this treatment the cavity soon becomes obliterated as healing
occurs. The bursae most commonly involved are the
<i>prepatellar</i> and that over the metatarsal joint of the great
toe.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Bursitis.</b> This affection may result from acute
bursitis which does not terminate in suppuration, or may
develop slowly from long continued irritation or pressure,
or from tubercular infection of the bursae and is accompanied
by little pain.</p>

<p>The most marked feature in chronic bursitis is the
distension of the sac with fluid, and in some cases the walls
of the sac become so thickened that the bursa is converted
into a solid tumor. Chronic bursitis of the prepatellar
bursae is not infrequent, and is commonly known us <i>Housemaid&#8217;s
knee</i>, resulting from long continued pressure upon
the knee occurring in those whose occupation causes them
to constantly bear pressure upon this part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Gumma of the prepatellar bursa is very common, and
should be suspected in every case of suppuration of this
bursa without assignable cause. It often results in extensive
sloughing.</p>

<p>Hernial protrusion of a portion of a bursa is sometimes
seen after injuries of bursae.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment of chronic bursitis, if the
sac is distended with fluid, consists in removal of the fluid
by aspiration, or by making an incision and introducing a
drain. The greatest care should be observed to keep the
wound aseptic. The bursae may be removed by dissection.
This is the only treatment which is likely to be of use in
cases where the bursa is very thick or is converted into a
solid tumor. In removing these growths by dissection,
great care should be exercised to avoid opening the neighboring
joints.</p>

<p><b>Bunion.</b> This is a bursal enlargement over the metatarsophalangeal
articulation of the great toe, which is very
frequently observed with hallux valgus, this being the most
universal cause. The part is swollen and tender upon pressure,
and if suppuration occurs the pain is severe, and
cellulitis is apt to develop, involving the surrounding parts,
or the joint may be involved, caries of the bones of the
articulation resulting.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> If suppuration has not occurred, the part
should be protected from pressure by a circular shield of
felt or plaster; if suppuration has taken place, the part
should be incised and drained, and if the joint is found
diseased it should be curreted and dressed with an antiseptic
dressing; if malposition of the toe exists, its position
should be corrected by amputation of the head of the
metatarsal.</p>

<p><b>Inflammation of Synovial and Serous Membranes.</b>
When the serous and synovial membranes are attacked by
inflammation, the stage of congestion is accompanied by
exudation of serum and fibrin from the surface, and the
endothelial cells become swollen and detached in large numbers.
The serous exudation may be sufficient to fill the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
entire cavity involved. There is a form of dry or fibrinous
inflammation, without fluid exudate, in which the surface
of the membrane loses its polish, becoming dry and red,
and adhesions readily form wherever the surfaces are in
contact.</p>

<p>In suppurative inflammation, pus is produced by
emigration, and also by the detached endothelial cells. If
fibrin is present, false membranes form on the surface and
the membrane itself appears to be greatly thickened. At
a later stage the proliferating cells invade these layers of
fibrin and they become organized into connective tissue, and
new vessels develop on them. Their tendency, however, is
to disappear after a time, and the membrane returns to its
original condition, unless the inflammation has been very
intense, in which case the new connective tissue becomes
permanent. Chronic inflammation of these membranes is
marked by general thickening of all the layers, the formation
of dense connective tissue in the fibrinous membranes,
strong adhesions, and sometimes complete obliteration of
the cavities, their endothelial lining disappearing entirely.</p>

<h3><b>SYNOVITIS</b></h3>

<p>Like other structures of the body the joints are subject
to injury and disease and because of the nature and course
of pathologic processes in them, one should bear in mind
their anatomic construction.</p>

<p>The expanded ends of the bones in the joints are
covered with a thin layer of cartilage and are bound to
each other by a dense capsule which is firmly attached to
the bones at their necks, where it is closely connected with
the periosteum. The joint cavity is lined (excepting where
additional fibrocartilages are present) with a synovial sac
which sometimes communicates with a bursa.</p>

<p>Inflammations of varying intensity are of frequent
occurrence; they maybe due to rheumatism or gout, to
traumatism, to the action of microorganisms, or, to disturbances
of innervation. They may be slight or severe, acute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
or chronic. They may terminate in resolution, in permanent
new formations, more or less deforming and disabling,
or in the destruction of the articulation.</p>

<p>Inflammations may arise in the joint structures proper
or may extend to it from contiguous structures, such as the
cancellous bone ends, the overlying tendons or the periarticular
connective tissue. They may be largely confined to
a single structure, the synovial membrane being ordinarily
affected, or they may involve the whole joint.</p>

<p><b>Acute synovitis.</b> Synovitis may occur as a result of a
simple injury, such as a subcutaneous wound, a contusion,
or a sprain. Exposure to cold and the presence of a movable
cartilage are also common causes. Aseptic conditions
in the synovial membrane seldom extend to the other joint
structures (see &#8220;Arthritis&#8221;) and heal with or without impairment
of the joint, depending on the degree of inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The joint is painful, especially upon
motion, and particularly so at night. It is swollen and
tense and may be fluctuating. At the knee, the patella is
floated up from the condyles and can be depressed upon
slight pressure. The joint is held in a position of partial
flexion which permits of the greatest ease, because of the
diminished tension in this position.</p>

<p>Local heat and tenderness are not necessarily great,
and constitutional symptoms, if present, are moderate in
degree.</p>

<p>In the suppurative affections of joints, all of the above
symptoms are intense and there is a general arthritis.</p>

<p>After a few hours or days the intensity of the symptoms
subsides, the pain lessens, the swelling diminishes, as
the effusion and extravasated blood are absorbed, the limb
takes its natural position, and recovery promptly takes
place. If there has been much hemorrhage into the joint,
adhesions due to the organization of the clot may cause
some restriction of motion.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The joint must be placed at rest and an
ice bag kept in constant contact. Even pressure with cotton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and broad bandages often hastens absorption, but cannot
at first be borne with comfort.</p>

<p>In rare instances aspiration of the effusion must be
resorted to, but the certainty should exist that absorption
is impossible, before a joint is punctured. The greatest
care must be exercised in introducing a needle into a joint
to avoid infection.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Synovitis.</b> While it is true that an inflammation
of a synovial membrane cannot long remain without
extending to the other joint structures, the fact remains
that symptoms peculiar to synovitis often persist for
months. These are properly viewed as constituting a condition
of chronicity. The active swelling and abundant effusion,
belonging to the acute stage, subside, but an undue
amount of fluid remains, with some pain and weakness.</p>

<p>If, with proper treatment and rest, these symptoms
persist, there is an extension of the process to the bone
ends and an exacerbation of symptoms.</p>

<p>The subsidence of a chronic synovitis generally leaves
a weak and impaired joint, though pain may be absent.
Movements, especially in extension, are restricted, and grating
or cracking remain as evidences of the roughened membrane.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The mere presence of a superabundance
of fluid in a joint does not in itself constitute a diseased
state, but may be the evidence of impaired circulation of
the part. Absorption may occur with rest and tight bandaging,
or with massage, friction, and baking, results may
often be obtained. Certain cases resisting such procedures
are best treated with a plaster of Paris cast to immobilize
the part for several months. When the affection is of long
standing and the joint is much distended it may be termed
<i>hydrops articuli</i> or <i>hydrarthrosis</i>.</p>

<p>When, in spite of all the methods of treatment here
described, the condition does not yield, very good results
may be obtained by the aspiration of the fluid, and the
injection of a few drams of a three per cent. or five per
cent. solution of carbolic acid. This operation, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
simple, requires every aseptic precaution, and should never
be performed in the presence of any acute symptoms.</p>

<p>For other phases of Synovitis see Arthritis.</p>

<h3><b>ARTHRITIS</b></h3>

<p>The structures of a joint are: bone, cartilage, ligaments,
synovial membrane and, in some cases, fibrocartilage.
Hence, a joint inflammation is an inflammation of
all of these structures, and is designated, <i>arthritis</i>.</p>

<p>The inflammation may begin in any one of these structures,
but sooner or later, all are involved. The synovial
membrane, however, when inflamed, seems to prove an
exception to the rule in that inflammation may or may not
extend from it to the rest of the joint. If such an extension
does take place we have an arthritis.</p>

<p>We may therefore have two distinct classes of joint
inflammation: (1) the varieties of synovitis, and (2) the
varieties of arthritis. These inflammations may be acute
or chronic.</p>

<p>In synovitis there is only the inflammation of the
synovial membrane, while in arthritis there is inflammation
of the synovial membrane plus inflammation of the bone
covering (<i>periostitis</i>); of the bone (<i>osteitis</i>); of cartilage
(<i>chondritis</i>); of bone marrow (<i>osteomyelitis</i>); and also a
cellulitis of the ligaments attached to the joint involved.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms of arthritis are obviously
more severe than those of a simple articular synovitis and
are both local and general. The general symptoms arise
from the absorption into the circulation of either bacteria
or their toxins, and vary greatly in severity. There is
either a toxemia or a septicemia, with the usual symptoms
of a general sepsis.</p>

<p>The local symptoms are those common to synovitis and
arthritis: pain, tenderness, swelling, heat, redness and loss
of function. From these alone a differential diagnosis
between synovitis and arthritis cannot be made. If, however,
there is a sensation of crepitus conveyed to the examiner&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
hand upon passive motion, there is an arthritis present
beyond doubt. This symptom is due to the destruction
of the synovial covering of the bone ends involved, permitting
contact of bone with bone. It is more common to
chronic joint disease, but may also accompany acute conditions,
especially if they are severe.</p>

<p>Symptoms peculiar to the variety of infection and the
history as to duration, causation, course and number of
joints involved, must be considered in making a diagnosis
or prognosis.</p>

<p><b>Varieties.</b> Besides simple traumatic arthritis, there
are many constitutional disorders which affect the joints
conspicuously; these are: tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea,
gout and rheumatism.</p>

<p>A prominent cause of many instances of arthritis heretofore
regarded as rheumatic in origin, is now known to
exist in any area of infection. Such &#8220;foci of infection&#8221;
discharge a certain amount of infective material into the
circulation, which may find lodgment in a joint and set up
an acute process.</p>

<p>It has been proven in numerous cases that a so-called
rheumatism will yield promptly to drainage of a chronic
abscess, no matter how remote the location. Oral conditions
especially have been found responsible for this form
of arthritis. Abscesses at the apexes of teeth and pyorrh&#339;a
alveolaris, when properly operated, yield nothing short of
miracles, in the way of relieved symptoms.</p>

<p>In addition to the varieties of arthritis already mentioned,
those due to certain infectious diseases, such as
measles, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, smallpox or erysipelas,
should be included, as well as cases of neuropathic origin.</p>

<h3><b>TRAUMATIC ARTHRITIS</b></h3>

<h4><b>Nonpenetrating and Penetrating</b></h4>

<p><b>Nonpenetrating.</b> Ordinary contusions or twisting at a
joint, may result in the establishment of an inflammatory
process within the joint, evidenced by much swelling and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
giving the sensation of fluctuation to the examining hands,
indicating the presence of fluid within the synovial membrane.
This occurs also when there is a detached fibrocartilage
in the joint. The synovial membrane is thickened
and there is an exudation of serum.</p>

<p>Sprains belong in this classification. These are simple,
clean, inflammatory conditions.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> These are generally limited to those
enumerated as belonging to synovitis, except that the disability
is more pronounced.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Rest and wet dressings generally suffice to
effect restitution in a few weeks.</p>

<p><b>Penetrating.</b> Should the joint be injured by violence
so that there is a loss of continuity of the tissues leading
into the joint proper, there is every probability of infective
material gaining entrance. These are serious accidents,
though restoration of an efficient joint is possible, but when
improperly treated or neglected, local destruction, or even
loss of life may occur.</p>

<p>Penetrating wounds of joints usually occur in consequence
of accidents with firearms, sharp tools, or falling
upon sharp objects. Frequently, penetration of a joint
follows suppuration in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The extent of the injury, the particular
joint involved, and the nature of the vulnerating body will
affect the train of symptoms. An escape of synovial fluid,
pain and some swelling will occur even with a very small
penetration. Should the joint escape infection, the synovitis
quickly subsides and recovery takes place with little or no
impairment of the functional value of the part. The opening
in the capsule closes, the extravasated blood is absorbed
and the synovial surface is again smooth. If, however, the
wound has been inflicted with an unclean instrument, or if
at any time before healing it becomes septic, a very different
and graver condition obtains.</p>

<p><b>Septic Arthritis.</b> Infection with bacteria of suppuration,
chiefly the staphylococcus albus or the streptococcus
pyogenes, produces an acute arthritis which frequently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
despite the most careful treatment, will result in the
destruction of the joint, and not seldom in the loss of life.</p>

<p>The infection may occur in one of several ways: (1)
directly through a dirty instrument, or the lodgment of
infective material in the tract leading to the joint cavity;
(2) by the extension of a suppurative process, either of
the bones or soft tissue adjacent; or, by (3) the deposition
into the joint of infective organisms circulating in the blood
stream.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> However produced, large numbers of
organisms are present and a high grade of inflammation
ensues. An abundant amount of pus is soon formed; the
synovial membrane, the bone ends and the joint capsule
are actively inflamed, and soon become disorganized. Perforation
of the capsule is followed by infection and suppuration
of the tendons and other structures about the
joint, which soon affects the superficial structures and
forms an opening through the skin. The pain is intense,
generally worse at night; the swelling is great and fluctuation
is distinct; the skin is red and hot, and the parts above
and below are edematous. Any attempt at motion increases
the suffering.</p>

<p>With these local symptoms there is an accompanying
train of constitutional symptoms which may eventuate
fatally. At first there is a chill, or a sensation of chilliness
after which the temperature quickly runs up several degrees,
and either remains so, or goes down and up several
times in twenty-four hours, as in other septic conditions.
The pulse may be strong and full at first, but soon becomes
rapid and weak. In very acute cases, death from septicemia
may occur in a few days.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases, drainage of the pus, either naturally
or artificially, will result in a remission of the symptoms
both locally and generally.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In this, as in other suppurative processes,
safety lies in the prompt opening of the abscesses and the
evacuation of the pus, thus accomplishing free drainage,
with subsequent disinfection by means of applications or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
irrigations. Immobilization of the parts and rigid antisepsis
will generally yield good results as to life, though
recovery with ankylosis is the rule. In the most severe
cases, constitutional symptoms are so grave as to warrant
immediate amputation above the infected joint.</p>

<p><b>Tubercular Arthritis.</b> The great majority of chronic
joint diseases are tubercular in origin, the tubercle bacilli
being deposited in any of the joint structures, or in structures
contiguous to a joint; with children, very frequently
in the bone substance.</p>

<p>Whether the tubercular process originates in the joint
cavity itself or outside of it in the surrounding tissues,
destruction of the articular ends of the bones is usual.</p>

<p>The parts become thickened and edematous; there is
a gelatinous or cheesy appearance, in which the membrane,
cartilaginous bone ends, capsule, and ligamentous structures
all share. Frequently the synovial membrane is
studded with miliary tubercles and its cavity is filled with
an abundant serous secretion. The contour of the joint
becomes globular or spindle shaped, because of the atrophy
of the parts above and below it and the swelling of the
periarticular structures. The skin becomes white and thick
because of the obliteration of the superficial vessels and
because of its edematous infiltration.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> Pain is, as a rule, but slight in the strictly
synovial stage of tubercular arthritis, but when the bones
are involved, it is severe, though acute symptoms, such as
heat and redness, are lacking.</p>

<p>Deformity is a constant accompaniment of the disease;
its degree is greater or less according to the joint affected,
the extent of the disease, and the treatment pursued. It is
due to the natural tendency to assume the position of greatest
ease; to the softening and destruction of the ligaments,
and to the effort on the part of nature to immobilize an
injured member by means of tonic contraction of the
muscles. These causes often result in the creation and
persistence of a malformation and malposition of the part.</p>

<p>Cheesy degeneration and liquefaction take place in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
more or less degree, and though their occurrence is often not
evidenced by any aggravation of the symptoms, sinus
formation with persisting discharge occurs.</p>

<p>When these sinuses occur, they generally become infected
with other pus producing organisms, and aggravate
the condition considerably. In the course of months or
years, many such openings may occur through which masses
of soft tissue or bone, either carious or necrosed (<i>sequestra</i>),
may be discharged.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> This may be easy, difficult, or impossible,
depending on the duration, the joint involved, and the character
of the disease in any individual case.</p>

<p>At times it is impossible to differentiate from syphilis,
which, however, is quite uncommon, but with which tuberculosis
has many symptoms in common. The history of the
individual, and a blood examination will generally suffice.
If the disease is advanced to the stage of abscess and sinus
formation, there can be no doubt as the nature of the
trouble.</p>

<p>Very often the disease in the articular ends of the
bones advances slowly, giving very little pain and no appreciable
swelling or atrophy. There may be only an unwillingness
to use the part very much, and the disease may
very well be overlooked. In such insidious cases a diagnosis
can be reached by aspiration and subsequent examination
of the serous fluid for tubercle bacilli. An X-ray will show
the rarifaction of the bony structures and the thickened
periosteum.</p>

<p>The course of tubercular joint disease is entirely
dependent upon its extent at the time it is recognized, and
the treatment pursued. It is of paramount importance that
attention be given any persisting pain or discomfort in or
near a joint, and that rest and every diagnostic aid be
employed before pronouncing a case hysteria, neuralgia or
&#8220;growing pains.&#8221; In a few cases the process can be
arrested and little or no diminution of function remains.
This, however, is the exception; there is usually destruction
of the intra-articular cartilages, and of the synovial membrane,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and the formation of bands of great density, which
impair the motion of the part even to rigidity (<i>fibrous
ankylosis</i>). The restriction of motion may be absolute if
ossification of the granulation tissue lying between the
epiphyses unites their eroded ends (<i>bony ankylosis</i>).</p>

<p>At times, though recovery seems to have been secured,
a sinus may persist because of some slight area of remaining
caries, or because the tract itself is tubercular. In
other instances a recurrence may follow after months or
years of quiescence. This may be due to the setting free
of encapsulated organisms, or because of a new infection at
a point of least resistance.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> is that of tubercular disease in general. The
most essential features in the conduct of these cases are
rest and the establishment of ideal hygienic conditions.
Forced feeding, sunlight and air, play as important a part
here as in pulmonary tuberculosis. Absolute rest of the
part can be secured only with the aid of plaster of Paris
braces, or splints of other materials. Such immobilization
should include the joints immediately above and below the
one affected. Hyperemia, by the use of a rubber bandage
above the joint, or by baking of the joint, is of great value.</p>

<p>In the majority of instances these methods will yield
good results in from six months to a year. Operative interference
will be necessary in addition to the above, where
caseation and secondary infection have occurred. Thorough
drainage of the infected joint, either by widening already
existing sinuses, or by free incision followed by irrigation,
will frequently be necessary.</p>

<p><b>Joints Generally Involved</b> are the larger ones of the
extremities, but this does not preclude the possibility of
any joint being the seat of a tubercular inflammation. The
vertebral articulations and the digital articulations of the
feet and hands are commonly affected. In children, the hip
joint is the one most attacked; frequently the knee, ankle
and elbow are affected in the order given.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases of arthritis of tubercular origin the
original focus of infection is located in the bone, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the synovial membrane, or an adjacent osteomyelitis, may
be the first point attacked.</p>

<p><b>Syphilitic Arthritis.</b> This is rather a rare condition,
but must be differentiated from tuberculosis, because of its
slow onset and progress, and because of the mildness of
the symptoms and the spindlelike shape of the joint. There
is usually but one joint involved and eventually a dark
fluid will escape should sinus formation occur.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis</b> will generally be known in advance from the
history, through a Wassermann test of the blood, or an
X-ray picture will often be of value.</p>

<p>In syphilis, the original focus of infection in a joint
will be found in the soft tissues, while in tuberculosis, the
articular ends of the bone are first involved. An examination
of the discharged fragments of tissue in syphilis
will show a round cell infiltration; in tuberculosis, possibly
typical tubercle tissue.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> by anti-syphilitic remedies, if successful,
will also indicate the nature of an obscure case, a pronounced
response to such treatment being a positive
diagnostic aid.</p>

<p><b>Gonorrhoeal Arthritis.</b> This affection is nearly always
very acute, beginning as an acute synovitis and extending
to the articular fibrocartilages at an early date.</p>

<p>Constitutional symptoms nearly always accompany
this variety of arthritis, a chill and high temperature being
the rule.</p>

<p>This condition is often called gonorrhoeal rheumatism.
It is due to the lodgment of the gonococcus of Neisser in
the joint, from the blood stream.</p>

<p>Gonorrhoeal arthritis is a form of septic arthritis, its
pathology and symptomatology being in many respects the
same. It may, in favorable cases, limit itself to the synovial
membrane, in which event the symptoms will yield more
readily to treatment, though the affection in any event is
an acute one, and a diagnosis as to extent is difficult to
make owing to the extreme pain of even slight motion.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> These are similar to those of septic arthritis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
except that usually only one joint is affected and the
existence of a gonorrhoeal infection can always be determined.
Both knees, or both ankles, but more commonly,
only one joint, are affected, accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms. There rarely occurs any indication of
sinus formation or of spontaneous drainage in this variety
of arthritis, and it is held by many, that in cases where
this tendency exists, there is a mixed infection, other pus
producing organisms being present.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The original infection of the urologic tract
must receive the utmost care, in order to eradicate the
supply of germs to the circulation. The injection of anti-gonococcic
sera or vaccines finds its best application in these
cases. The local treatment consists of rest and immobilization
of the extremity affected.</p>

<p>The application of either extreme heat or cold to the
joint is agreeable and efficacious.</p>

<p>There are many reasons in justification of either of
these treatments over the other, but in general it may be
said that, in the acute stage, cold is better, while in the
latter stages, heat will accomplish more to establish easy
motion of the part and to lessen the danger of ankylosis.</p>

<p>Active or arterial hyperemia by baking, is especially
valuable in the subacute stage.</p>

<p><b>Prognosis.</b> In those cases in which the pain and swelling
is severe and the constitutional symptoms alarming,
we may always expect a true arthritis to exist. In these
cases much exudate is formed in the joint, which upon
organization, leads to fibrous bands and limitation of the
joint function (<i>fibrous ankylosis</i>).</p>

<p>In the milder cases, ankylosis is the exception, if proper
remedial measures are carried out.</p>

<p><b>Rheumatic Arthritis.</b> Rheumatic articular affections
are common, and are both acute or chronic. In the light
of recent investigations it is believed that many of these
cases are due to foci of infection in various parts of the
body which pollute the blood stream with organisms which
subsequently find lodgment in either the organs or joints.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Infections existing in the tonsils and teeth roots have
been shown to act in this way. There may, however, be
cases directly attributable to rheumatism, though these are
not so well understood.</p>

<p><b>Acute Rheumatism.</b> One or several joints may be
attacked simultaneously. Subsidence of the inflammation
may occur, while others are becoming inflamed.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b> are those of acute synovitis; suppuration
never occurs unless there has been a mixed infection, and
limitation of motion is a rare sequela. The pain, swelling
and tenderness is extreme, and the constitutional symptoms,
while being severe are not usually grave. In the
<i>chronic variety</i>, on the other hand, there may be limitation
of motion due to the formation of bands and adhesions
after months or years of inflammation. This variety may
start as such or may begin as an acute condition.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment, besides local rest and heat,
consists of the administration of antirheumatic remedies
and hygienic precautions.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis</b> will rest largely on the blood examination
for circulating organisms, the general examination for foci
of infection, and the family history.</p>

<p><b>Gouty Arthritis.</b> Whatever may be the essential nature
of gout, its manifestations are common in the smaller joints,
such as the fingers and the metatarsophalanges of the great
toe. Deposits of urates, chiefly sodium urate, take place
in the connective tissue of the joint and also in the cartilage.
Consequent upon the irritation of these salts, there is an
increase in the connective tissue followed by contraction,
impairment of motion, and alteration in the shape of the
joint. Repeated attacks of acute inflammation occur, of
greater or lesser intensity, and the uratic deposits attain a
considerable size, occasionally forming abscesses or ulcerations
in the overlying skin.</p>

<p>Like rheumatism, gout is a manifestation of a constitutional
state, and requires medical care.</p>

<p><b>Infective Arthritis.</b> These are the arthritic manifestations
of diseases as smallpox, scarlet fever, typhoid fever,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
measles and erysipelas. They are due to infective material
deposited from the circulation, and are in every way similar
to septic arthritis, which see. There are always suppurative
synovitis and osteomyelitis, with a consequent
ankylosis of bony structure. The constitutional symptoms
are very intense, and free incision and drainage is indicated.</p>

<p><b>Neuropathic Arthritis.</b> (<i>Charcot&#8217;s Disease</i>). This is
a peculiar osteoarthritis observed in patients with locomotor
ataxia. The disease is an acute one, so far as objective
conditions are concerned, there being no pain or constitutional
derangements of consequence. Without any
injury having been received, the joint, particularly the knee,
suddenly swells, the intra-articular effusion becoming abundant.
This may soon be absorbed and with it the articular
ends of the bones wear away and break down into small
fragments. The limb becomes atrophied and shrunken, and
the joint itself becomes weak, often flail.</p>

<p>This disease seems to be due to nutritive changes in
consequence of changes in the spinal cord nerve centres.
There is no satisfactory treatment and the patients must
be kept in bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><b>DISEASES OF THE BONES</b></h3>

<p><b>Congenital Defects of Bones.</b> Various congenital deformities
of the limbs occur because of interference in
various ways with the proper and normal formation of
these cartilaginous masses. If, for any reason, the cause
of which in most cases is not clear, any of these cartilaginous
masses fail to be formed in the embryonic tissues,
naturally no ossification can occur, and in such cases there
may be a partial or complete lack of development of the
corresponding bone. The amount of this congenital deformity
may vary from the absence of an entire foot, to
the absence of one or several digits, or one or more
phalanges.</p>

<p>The deformities produced by such a failure to deposit
the cartilaginous base of the bones are very numerous, and
in some cases lead to great deformity and loss of function.
This lack or increase of the reformation in cartilage, results
in most extraordinary deformities.</p>

<p>No special type of deformity merits special attention;
the condition in each case must be decided by inspection
and X-ray examination.</p>

<p>In many of these cases, especially where the lesion
affects the digits, the capability of the individual is but
little impaired, whilst in other cases, where bones are
absent, marked deformity and impairment of function may
occur. Some of the cases, notably webbed toes, are comparatively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
easily corrected; other cases however, offer little
chance of sufficient cosmetic or functional gain to make a
surgical operation necessary or desirable.</p>

<p><b>Atrophy of Bone.</b> Various causes may lead to atrophy
of bone. The method by which atrophy is brought about
is peculiar, and is due to the action of special giant cells,
called osteoclasts. Wherever extensive atrophy of bone
takes place, microscopic inspection shows such giant cells
lying closely adjacent to the trabeculae of the bone which
is being resorbed, and the trabeculae in that immediate
vicinity slowly disappear under the action of these giant
cells. Their action is very similar to the action of giant
cells in the soft tissues about absorbable foreign bodies.
This process is called <i>lacunar resorption</i>.</p>

<p>In old people the amount of absorption oftentimes is
very great; the process is then termed <i>senile atrophy</i>. It
may be marked in the skull and in the long bones, and in
many cases of fracture of the neck of the femur, a moderate
amount of lacunar resorption precedes the fracture which
results from slight violence. In certain cases this resorptive
process in old people is extreme, and leads to great
fragility of the bones, with repeated fractures from slight
violence, which under ordinary circumstances, would cause
no injury at all.</p>

<p>A mere lack of use of bones may also lead to a certain
amount of atrophy from lacunar resorption. This may be
seen after amputations, where the stump of bone which is
left from the amputation slowly undergoes lacunar resorption
and sometimes a marked diminution in size. The same
thing may also be seen in the bones of people who for long
periods of time have been deprived of the use of their
limbs, either by the application of apparatus around fractures,
or by disuse for other reasons.</p>

<p>Lacunar resorption also occasionally follows lesions of
the central nervous system, part of the atrophy being due
to disuse of the limbs from the paralysis, and part of it
also being dependent in some indirect way upon the nerve
lesion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Atrophy of bone also may be brought about by pressure.
It is to be remembered that the bone, as a matter
of fact, is not a perfectly rigid material, but that processes
of new formation and resorption are constantly taking
place, even under normal conditions. If, for any reason,
bone is put under constant pressure, a certain amount of
readjustment of the bony constituents takes place in order
to adapt the bone to its altered condition. The most striking
example of this sort of atrophy is perhaps the Chinese
ladies&#8217; feet, where the bones, being bent into an abnormal
position, beginning early in childhood, ultimately show
enormous deformity and an entire rearrangement of the
trabeculae of the bone. The same thing also may be seen
occasionally after pressure and deformity from contracture
of muscles or from the pressure of scars. This process,
which ordinarily leads to loss of function, in a certain
limited number of cases aids function, for whilst certain
fractures of the joints may lend to deformity of the articular
facets of those joints, by absorption of certain portions
and new formation in others, a readjustment of the
joint surface may take place, so that a marked increase of
function may occur.</p>

<p>A certain amount of atrophy also may be brought
about by the pressure and development of tumors.</p>

<p><b>Hypertrophy of Bone.</b> In many cases new growth of
bony tissue is due to the new formation of periosteal bone,
and is an expression of an attempt at repair of one or the
other of the numerous destructive processes. In other cases
true hypertrophy of the bone, with no connection with any
reparative process, may occur.</p>

<p>A notable example of this is seen in the growth of
bone which sometimes occurs after amputation, especially
in young people. The increased size of the bones which is
seen in many definite diseases will be mentioned under the
proper headings.</p>

<p><b>Caries and Necrosis.</b> Various pathologic processes
produce destruction of bone. The destructive process may
cause the death of large areas of the affected bone at once,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and in that case, a large fragment of necrotic bone may
remain in situ and still maintain its contour. Destruction
of bone of this sort is described by the clinical term
<i>necrosis</i>.</p>

<p>Other processes cause a gradual molecular softening
and destruction of bone, which ultimately may be very
extensive, but at no time is there present any appreciable
large mass of bone. Destruction of this sort is described
by the clinical term <i>caries</i>.</p>

<p>As a means of differentiating clinical conditions, the
use of these two words is desirable. As a clinical term,
<i>necrosis</i> usually means destruction by pyogenic infection,
and <i>caries</i>, destruction by the gradual extension of a tuberculous
process. This clinical distinction, however, is not
an exact one, because destruction of large areas of bone,
described as necrosis, is occasionally brought about by
syphilitic infection, and rarely by tuberculosis, whilst
molecular destruction of the bone is brought about by a
considerable variety of processes, the chief of which, it is
true, is tuberculous infection, but actinomycosis and
syphilis may both lead to the gradual disintegration of the
bone, without the formation of large necrotic masses of
bone.</p>

<p>The presence of necrotic bone connected with the surface
of sinuses, from which comes a discharge of pus,
should always lead to the consideration of tuberculosis,
actinomycosis, and syphilis. The presence of large
sequestra of bone should immediately suggest the presence
of osteomyelitis or of syphilis.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>The details of the treatment of the various
forms of destructive processes in bone will be found under
their special headings, chiefly under osteomyelitis and
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In all cases of caries it is desirable to remove completely
the softened areas in the bone. This may be done
by curettment and drainage, or by excision of the entire
bone, or series of bones, in certain cases, or rarely by
amputation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty in all these cases is to recognize the exact
limits of the carious process. It must be borne in mind
that at the time of operation upon carious bones the field
of vision of the surgeon is almost always limited; moreover,
the bleeding which always takes place from the bone-marrow
in such cases, also obscures the field, and even if
these two causes were not present, it is frequently extremely
difficult, by naked-eye examination to determine
the exact limits of the destructive process. As a general
rule, it can be said that the carious area is at least a quarter
of an inch wider than appears upon visual inspection.</p>

<p>In cases of necrosis with large bone defects, the difficult
thing is to cause a growth of the bone toward the
central cavity after removal of the sequestrum. The
various methods applicable to such cavities are mentioned
in detail under &#8220;Osteomyelitis.&#8221;</p>

<h4><b>PERIOSTITIS</b></h4>

<p><b>Acute Periostitis.</b> The older text books always laid
great stress upon the occurrence of an acute infectious
inflammation of the periosteum. Acute suppurating periostitis
alone does not occur, and most of the cases which have
been described as such are really mild cases of superficial
osteomyelitis, with abscess formation beneath the periosteum,
and possibly slight inflammation of the periosteum
itself.</p>

<p>These cases ordinarily lead to only a slight destruction
of the outer layer of the cortical bone.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> These are the same as in acute osteomyelitis,
except in a very much milder form. There is usually
a rise of temperature, oftentimes with a chill, with circumscribed
tenderness over some portion of the shaft of one
of the long bones.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Incision over such an area shows an
elevated periosteum, with a small, localized abscess beneath
it, with bare, white, somewhat vascular bone cortex. Incision
alone in most cases suffices to cure the disease, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
if the process has extended sufficiently deep to cause a
superficial necrosis of the outer layer of the cortex, removal
of a small sliver of necrotic bone may be necessary.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Periostitis.</b> A long-continued and chronic irritation
of the periosteum, sufficient to cause a proliferation
of the osteogenetic cells of the periosteum, is common in a
great many diseases. A chronic thickening of the periosteum
with a new formation of bone, is seen frequently after
traumatism, blows or contusions; sometimes after the
occurrence of superficial abscess of the soft tissues in the
immediate vicinity of the shaft of the long bone, described
as chronic ulcer of the surface of the tibia; or after certain
infectious diseases, notably syphilis. It also may occur
after various other local infections. In such cases the
thickening of the periosteum ordinarily is pretty sharply
localized.</p>

<p>A general thickening over the periosteum, and over
several or many of the bones of the body, also occurs in the
disease known as <i>toxic osteoperiostitis ossificans</i>, seen in
diseases with long continued suppuration. It also is common
after syphilitic disease, either congenital or acquired.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms of chronic periostitis with
new formation of bone are invariable. In a certain number
of cases there is a constant, heavy, dull pain, at the point
of thickening, with at times more or less acute exacerbation;
at other times the lesion is associated with no pain whatever,
and the patient&#8217;s attention is first called to the disease
by the presence of the enlargement of bone. Recognition of
the condition may depend upon X-ray examinations for
indefinite pains in or over the bone.</p>

<p>Chronic periostitis is not really a disease itself, but a
manifestation of the reaction of the periosteum to some
irritant.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> of the condition depends, first of all, upon a
recognition of the cause and a removal of the cause, when
possible. In many cases, especially those in which no pain
is present, nothing in the way of therapeutic measures can
be done.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The chronic thickening of the periosteum, seen in many
definite bone diseases, will be mentioned under those diseases.</p>

<p><b>Osteomyelitis.</b> Infectious osteomyelitis is acute suppuration
of the bone, always due to the infection of the
bone marrow by pyogenic microorganisms. The process is
essentially like the process seen in furuncle, and begins in
the marrow of the alveolar spaces, which communicate
freely with each other, but are enclosed by a dense shell of
cortical bone. Hence the process may quickly at first
involve the entire marrow of an infected bone, because the
products of bacterial infection are retained in this dense
shell, while the primary focus can only be reached by extensive
bone operation.</p>

<p>Most cases are due to the staphylococcus pyogenes
aureus and a few to the streptococcus. Typhoid bacilli may
cause suppuration. The infecting organism is present in
pure culture but sometimes a mixed infection occurs, and
such cases are said to be severe.</p>

<p>In cases of chronic osteomyelitis with open sinuses and
exposed bone, a great variety of organisms, pathologic and
saprophytic, may be present. Hence infectious osteomyelitis
is not a specific disease, but is acute inflammation of
bone that may be produced by any one of a variety of
pathogenic organisms, or by a mixed infection.</p>

<p>Any pyogenic organism which can be carried in the
blood may be deposited in the bone and produce suppuration.
Some of these organisms may settle by preference
in the bone marrow, others beneath the periosteum, or in
the joint.</p>

<p>Certain general causes favor the occurrence of osteomyelitis.
Children are chiefly affected and it occurs in
boys about three times as often as in girls. Acute osteomyelitis
frequently occurs after injuries of moderate severity,
because such injuries may lower resistance of the bones
and make them unusually susceptible to pyogenic infection.
One of the commonest causes is the infection of a
compound fracture, and before the days of asepsis, such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
cases were very frequently fatal. Under modern methods
the infection, when it does occur, is generally slight,
although the destruction of bone may greatly delay healing
and may lead to the formation of small sequestra and indurating
sinuses. Infection of a similar sort may occur
subsequent to amputation.</p>

<p>Osteomyelitis nearly always begins in the diaphysis of
the long bones, usually near the epiphyseal line. This is
an important point, clinically, because tuberculosis practically
begins in the epiphysis. In rare cases, however,
osteomyelitis begins in the epiphysis, and so may simulate
tuberculosis. The femur and tibia are the bones most frequently
attacked, but no bone is exempt. Usually only one
bone is affected, but cases of multiple bone infections are
not rare.</p>

<p>The primary area of infection is always in the bone
marrow. The bony trabeculae and the cortex are destroyed
only secondarily. The process nearly always begins in the
diaphysis, but then may extend into the epiphysis and produce
suppuration of the joint. Once the organisms have
gained access to the marrow, they produce a toxin which
causes necrosis of the adjacent marrow cells, and this
necrosis may extend over a very considerable portion of
the bone before marked infiltration with leucocytes occurs.
The infection usually extends quite early through the dense
cortex by way of the Haversian canals, and produces an
inflammatory exudation and suppuration between the
periosteum and the outer layer of the cortex, which is designated
<i>subperiosteal abscess</i>.</p>

<p>Such an abscess may strip the periosteum from the
bone over very extensive areas. The infection may then
extend to the adjacent soft parts, muscles and subcutaneous
tissue, and form an abscess outside the periosteum.</p>

<p>If, from spontaneous opening of the abscess or from
operation, a fatal result is avoided, the infective process
may be limited and the process of repair may begin.</p>

<p>As a rule, a portion of the infected marrow and
cortex become completely necrotic, and the lime-bearing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
portion of the bone persists as a more or less extensive
sequestrum.</p>

<p>The periosteum in the early stages may be separated
from the bone by a collection of pus, and in such cases it
appears as a thin fibrous membrane beneath the muscles,
separated from the bone by the abscess cavity.</p>

<p>Secondary changes occur in the soft tissues surrounding
the seat of an acute suppuration of bone. During the
acute stage there may be a definite abscess of the soft
parts, with an infiltration which simulates phlegmonous
inflammation, or, by rupture of the abscess, various sinuses
may be formed leading down to the necrotic foreign body.
In long continued cases the skin and subcutaneous tissues
become thickened by the formation of scar tissue, due to
the presence of the involucrum and the persistence of
sinuses, and by thickening of the soft tissues, an affected
limb may for years be nearly twice its normal size.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The disease usually begins with a sharp
onset, the first symptom being a sudden localized pain in
the vicinity of the epiphyseal line, or in the shaft of some
one of the long bones. This pain is extremely intense, and
in typical cases is most excruciating.</p>

<p>Motion of the joints at this time is not painful, but
the pain produced by percussing the bone, even lightly, may
be intense. An extremely valuable diagnostic point is continued
gentle pressure at some point over the shaft of the
bone at a distance from the point of greatest constant pain.</p>

<p>Usually, at a very early period, there appears swelling
of the soft parts about the bone. This swelling, at first,
is neither hot nor red, but soon becomes edematous, red,
and shows pitting on pressure, and at that time may simulate
acute phlegmon.</p>

<p>In some cases the adjacent joint early becomes tender,
hot and swollen, and this may occur even when there is no
real extension of the infectious process to the joint itself.
If extension does occur to the joint, swelling, tenderness,
and pain on motion become more intense. The temperature
usually is elevated to a considerable degree&#8212;103&deg;F. or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
104&deg;F.&#8212;and usually the pulse is greatly accelerated. Evidence
of constitutional disturbance and absorption of infectious
material occur early. The tongue is dry, coated
and tremulous; the face is drawn and flushed. Delirium
of a mild type is a very common symptom, and in some
cases this delirium may persist for a considerable length
of time after the bone has been drained. Abscess of the
soft parts may give deep or superficial fluctuation. Sinuses
may appear. The leucocyte count is usually very high&#8212;25000
to 35000,and chiefly of a polynuclear type.</p>

<p>Such a clinical picture is perfectly distinct, and it is
difficult to overlook typical cases, especially after the
fluctuation in the soft parts has occurred. The diagnosis
of early cases, however, is sometimes very difficult, and even
in the hands of experienced men, who have the lesion in
mind, is frequently impossible. Even in severe cases, occasionally
the pain itself is not severe for several days, when
there may come a sudden exacerbation of symptoms.</p>

<p>In the chronic stages of osteomyelitis the symptoms
are usually characteristic. The limb is enlarged, the enlargement
being partly due to thickening of the soft tissues,
but chiefly to the formation of the involucrum. Usually
running down to the sequestrum, are enormous sinuses,
from which comes a foul, purulent discharge. On passing
a probe, dead bone can be felt at the bottom of the sinuses.
It must be borne in mind, however, that in a great many
cases, after attacks of osteomyelitis of moderate severity,
small localized abscesses are formed in the shaft of the
long bones, with no sinus communicating with the surface.
An abscess of this description, as has already been stated,
is always surrounded by a wall of dense bonelike cortical
bone.</p>

<p>Such an abscess may persist for years with no symptoms
beyond a moderate enlargement of the shaft of the
bone at the point of abscess, and the enlargement may be
so slight that it is not recognized by the patient. In other
cases the entire shaft may be enlarged, but the bone may
not be tender. In most cases, however, such a localized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
abscess sooner or later gives rise to recurring attacks of
pain, which, as a rule, are extremely violent. The intervals
between such attacks may vary from days to weeks, or
to months, or even to years. The attacks of pain may come
on, apparently, perfectly spontaneously. Associated with
these attacks of pain, the bone over the abscess usually is
exceedingly tender to touch. With the attacks of pain may
come a rise of temperature, or in some cases, there may
be no disturbance of the general condition. This kind of
abscess may be of small size, no larger than a pea, or may
involve a great portion of the shaft of the bone; in such
abscesses no definite sequestrum may ever form.</p>

<p>The recognition of such conditions depends upon recurrent
attacks of violent pain over circumscribed areas of
bone, with or without constitutional disturbance, and nearly
always with extreme local tenderness.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In the acute stage there is suppuration of
the marrow, more or less extended throughout the shaft,
with often a subperiosteal abscess and perhaps abscess of
the soft parts.</p>

<p>The indications are the same as in any other acute
suppuration; the pus must be evacuated and the bone cavity
drained. This demands not only an incision into the soft
parts, but an opening into the shaft of the bone. If a piece
of necrotic bone is present, it should be removed.</p>

<p>In the chronic stage there is usually an old necrotic
shaft perforated by sinuses, and often freely movable,
inclosed by a shell of dense periosteal bone. The sequestrum
must be removed, but the bony defect fails to heal,
and for months persists as a filthy, discharging cavity, with
the constant danger of secondary infection and phlegmon,
or erysipelatous inflammation. The healing of this cavity
is very difficult and requires a very long time.</p>

<p>Many methods have been tried for the filling of these
bone cavities with blood clot, iodoform and oil of sesame,
but they have not been successful, because it is almost impossible
to render such cavities absolutely aseptic.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis of Bone.</b> Tuberculosis of bone is always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
dependent upon infection of the marrow of bone by the
tubercule bacillus. This germ obtains entrance to the bone
marrow and causes the formation of miliary tubercules
which arise from the proliferation of the connective tissue
of the marrow around the primary tubercule. Other secondary
tubercules are formed by extension of the tubercule
bacillus. The centres of these tubercules become caseous,
and, by fusion of adjacent caseous areas, also cause softening
in the bone marrow.</p>

<p>The tuberculous process, as a rule, begins in the
epiphysis in the long bones, and may affect any of the
bones.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> In cases of tuberculous disease confined to
the bones alone, the first symptom usually is pain, which
ordinarily is not severe and has a gradual onset. Oftentimes,
at first on palpation, no difference in the shape of
the bone can be detected.</p>

<p>Toes affected by a tuberculous process, slowly enlarge
at first without heat or pain; ultimately the skin becomes
thickened, and reddened, and the digit is painful to pressure
or motion. Oftentimes the skin is perforated at one or
more points by sinuses lined with tuberculous granulations,
through which caseous pus is discharged.</p>

<p>The diagnosis in these cases always lies between tuberculosis,
actinomycosis, syphilis, and osteomyelitis, and
exact determination of the origin of the cause oftentimes
can be made only by inoculating animals with a discharge
from the sinus, or by detection of pyogenic organisms, or
of the miliary tubercule, the histologic unit of tuberculosis,
or by detecting the peculiar yellow bodies seen in actinomycosis.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> From a clinical point of view tuberculosis
of bone should be considered in the same category as
malignant disease, and the indications for treatment in all
cases of tuberculous bone disease are the same as in
malignant disease; which is, complete removal of the
infected area, whenever it is possible.</p>

<p>In some cases the mere opening and curetting of tuberculous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
areas in bone is oftentimes enough to set up sufficient
reaction in the bone and in the surrounding tissues,
to put an end to the tuberculous process. Complete resection
of bones may at times be avoided by this treatment.</p>

<p>In addition to the local treatment of opening, curetting
and drainage, or the complete excision of the bone, the
greatest care should be employed in the management of the
general hygiene of the patient, including feeding and fresh
air. Often removal to a climate which is unfavorable to
the development of tuberculosis in general, is also extremely
desirable.</p>

<p><b>Syphilis of Bone.</b> The lesions produced in bones by
syphilitic infection may be congenital or acquired, and, as
in other syphilitic lesions, the manifestations may be
protean.</p>

<p>Most children with congenital syphilis, show an irregularity
of the epiphyseal line, which results in the latter
becoming markedly toothed, instead of constituting a
straight line across the bone, at right angles to the long axis
of the shaft.</p>

<p>Besides the irregularity of the epiphyseal line, three
other changes are seen in the bones of syphilitic infection.
The most common lesion is one which affects the periosteum
and leads to the formation of periosteal bone. This periosteal
formation may occur either in congenital or in acquired
syphilis, and it may affect one or many bones. In some
cases there is an enormous thickening of the epiphysis of
the bones, and as a result of the epiphyseal thickening,
secondary changes in the joints occur, so that the thickening
of bones and the changes in the facets of the joints, suggest
fracture or dislocation. In other cases, the thickening
affects only the shafts of the long bones, generally of the
leg or arm, although no bones are exempt. In some cases,
both in the congenital and acquired forms, there may be
marked proliferation of the endosteum of the bone, with
or without thickening of the periosteum, although thickening
of the periosteum usually is present. This process, as
a rule, affects one bone in its entirety, and most commonly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
affects the bones of the lower leg, notably the tibia. As a
result of these changes the bones are enlarged and
thickened, and in some cases, from endosteal thickening,
the marrow canal is very largely or entirely obliterated.
In some cases true gummata of the bone are formed. These
gummata may appear in the spongy portion of the bone,
sometimes in the shaft, or in the epiphysis. They also
appear to be formed in the lower layers of the periosteum
and lead to circumscribed nodular thickenings on the surface
of the bone.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> These vary with the different pathologic
conditions present. The periosteal thickening may occur
at any time of life over any bone of the body.</p>

<p>The presence of circumscribed periosteal thickening
of bone in itself should always lead to the suspicion of the
presence of syphilis.</p>

<p>Pain, as a rule, is only very slight, and the diagnosis
depends upon the history and the detection of other
syphilitic lesions.</p>

<p>The cases in which there is both endosteal and periosteal
thickening, occur chiefly in children and are of a congenital
nature.</p>

<p>The physical symptoms are very characteristic. The
bone usually affected is the tibia, which is enlarged to a
most marked degree, and often shows a pronounced bowing
forward, similar to the bowing and thickening of the tibia
seen in osteitis deformans. The bone is extremely dense
and obviously heavier than normal. The bones are
moderately tender to pressure, but have nothing like the
extreme tenderness noted on pressure in osteomyelitic
bones.</p>

<p>In cases of gummata of bones the symptoms vary. In
some cases the gummata are on the surface of the bone,
especially the sternum, and at times on the long bones. In
such cases there appear a softening and reddening of the
skin about the affected area, which remains indolent for a
long time.</p>

<p>If such an area opens spontaneously, or is opened by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
incision, the contents are seen to be composed of a yellow,
rather gelatinous material, quite like the caseous material
from a tuberculous abscess.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In most cases the regular anti-syphilitic
treatment is indicated. In cases of periosteal thickening,
the results vary with the time at which the treatment is
begun. In the early cases, a thorough anti-syphilitic treatment
may lead, after a varying length of time, to complete
disappearance of the newly formed periosteal bone. On
the other hand, if the periosteal process has lasted for a
long time and the bone has become densely cortical,
although anti-syphilitic treatment may lead to a diminution
of the localized pain, the dense bone does not disappear.
In cases of combined endosteal and periosteal thickening,
the pain usually disappears under anti-syphilitic treatment
but the changes in the bone persist.</p>

<p><b>Osteomalacia</b> is an acquired disease which causes
marked softening and changes in the bones. The disease
begins irregularly and often progresses with or without
remissions. The progress is more marked during pregnancy.
The first sign is pain in the bones, which is increased
by pressure, and this is especially true of pressure
over the ribs. There are also muscular cramps and contractures.</p>

<p><b>Osteitis Deformans.</b> (<i>Paget&#8217;s Disease</i>). This is a
chronic disease of the bones and may affect one or more
bones of the body. The onset is insidious, and before actual
deformity occurs, long indefinite pains in the legs may have
existed, with occasional tender points over the bone.</p>

<p>The bony changes are first noticed in the bones of the
legs and are most marked in the tibia, femur and fibula.
As a result of structural changes, these bones become bowed,
while their internal trabecular structure is altered.</p>

<p>The extent of the affection in the bones of the legs
varies a great deal and usually is not symmetric. The lower
extremities are bowed outward, and also are usually bent
forward, the curves being due to changes in the femur and
the lower leg.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In the absence of any knowledge as to the
cause of the disease, the treatment of osteitis deformans
must be largely symptomatic. Certain drugs have been
recommended; among these are iodide of potash and
arsenic. Most such patients are in poor general condition,
and effective feeding often gives marked relief of the symptoms
from which they are suffering.</p>

<p>For severe pain, counterirritants are valuable, especially
the actual cautery. Massage is of use in some cases
for improving the general condition.</p>

<p><b>Tumors of Bone.</b> All the primary tumors of bone are
of the connective tissue group, but various secondary
tumors of epithelial origin may occur.</p>

<p>Osseous tumors may arise from the periosteum or from
the marrow. If they arise from the periosteum they may
extend early to the adjacent soft tissues and involve and
destroy them. If the tumor arises in the marrow, it is for
a long while cut off from the adjacent soft tissues by the
thick cortex, and about the extending medullary tumor may
also come a reactive proliferation by the periosteum, so
that as the tumor extends it still may, for a long time, be
surrounded by a shell of bone which prevents infection of
the soft parts. After a time, however, the reactive periosteum
shell usually becomes perforated at one or more
points, and then the medullary tumor extends to the adjacent
tissues. The cause of these tumors is absolutely
unknown.</p>

<p><b>Fibromata</b> are not very common tumors of bone. They
arise generally from the periosteum and are most common
about the face, and are rarely seen in the long bones. Many
of these tumors are closely allied to some of the fibrous
forms of sarcoma, and it is often difficult to distinguish
them histologically.</p>

<p><b>Chondromata</b> are fairly common tumors of bone. They
may appear externally to the cortex, or sometimes they
grow in the medullary canal. They may arise directly
from the marrow, probably from remnants of the provisional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
cartilage cells. They also appear frequently to arise
from the epiphyseal line.</p>

<p>Chondromata appear generally as multiple masses,
nodular in shape, and are frequently seen on the lower leg,
about the knee joint. They usually are painless, firm and
hard, and not tender to pressure.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> consists in removal by operation.</p>

<p><b>Osteomata</b> are bony tumors which generally arise by
growth of the periosteum, and form solid bony masses
external to the cortex of the bone, when they are called
<i>exostoses</i>.</p>

<p>The density of the bone composing the tumor varies a
great deal, some being very hard and ivorylike, while others
are like the cellular marrow of the long bones.</p>

<p>Osteomata may be surrounded by a layer of fibrous
periosteum or, in certain cases, beneath the periosteum
appears a layer of cartilage producing the so-called <i>exostosis
cartilaginea</i>. The latter formation is the one which is most
common in the vicinity of the epiphyseal line of the long
bones, notably of the leg.</p>

<p>Osteomata form circumscribed hard nodular masses of
bony consistency, and are usually painless. They may
cause interference with function from their size, especially
when they appear in close connection with a joint.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> is complete and thorough removal.</p>

<p><b>Sarcomata</b> are the most common tumors of bone; they
are malignant, and when removed, tend to recur, either
locally or by metastasis, in different parts of the body.
The metastases usually are distributed by the circulation.</p>

<p>These tumors may arise from the marrow, but generally
in the epiphysis of the bone and extend to the shaft only
at a later stage of their development. As the tumor
advances, it causes a softening and an absorption of the
original cellular marrow until it approaches the periosteum.</p>

<p>In many cases the periosteum, as about any form of
foreign body, then begins to proliferate and forms a shell
of periosteal bone surrounding the tumor. In that way the
shell of the bone oftentimes becomes very much enlarged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
before there is any extension of the process through the
shell to the adjacent tissue. By destruction of the marrow
and of the cortex, great softening of the bone may occur
so that spontaneous fractures not infrequently are seen.</p>

<p>Other sarcomata arise from the periosteum, and usually
originate from one side of the bone, although occasionally
they entirely surround the bone. In the periosteal sarcomata,
a new formation of bone is common and the bone
is frequently arranged in a radical way, giving a most
remarkable picture on the X-ray plate.</p>

<p><b>Myeloma</b> is a very rare malignant tumor of bone. Such
tumors always appear only in connection with bone, are
usually multiple, and are of the same type as other
lymphoid tumors.</p>

<p>The cells of such tumors resemble very closely the type
of plasma cell. These cells are arranged in masses without
an intercellular substance, and the tumors are closely allied
to the malignant lymphomata. The cases are always associated
with albuminuria.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The chief symptoms of malignant tumors
are swelling and pain, both of which oftentimes are extreme.
The swelling may be spherical or spindle shaped.</p>

<p><b>Extension</b> to the joints may not occur for a great length
of time. In many cases X-ray examination is the most
reliable method of detecting the character of the bony
change.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> of all sarcomata is early and complete
removal. This means in nearly all cases, amputation of
the affected bone, and it is important that the amputation
should be of the entire bone through the joint between the
bone and the body, rather than amputation of the bone in
continuity. The reason for this is, that even in sarcomata,
which have not extended to the soft parts, very frequently
there have occurred metastases of tumor-cells throughout
the blood sinuses of the affected bone, often times at a distance
of several inches from the site of the original primary
tumor.</p>

<p><b>Carcinomata.</b> Cancer of bone always is secondary to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cancer in some epithelial organ. The infection may take
place by direct extension through the blood or the
lymphatics.</p>

<p>In cases of metastatic invasions of bone, spontaneous
fractures oftentimes are the first symptom which calls
attention to the fact that metastases have occurred.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> As in other malignant tumors, the indication
is for absolute and radical removal whenever possible.
Unfortunately, this very seldom can be done, because at the
time the bone has become affected by extension to any great
degree, radical operation is impossible. Many times, however,
extensive operations must be undertaken for the
removal of bone.</p>

<p><b>Cysts of Bone</b> are rare lesions which practically always
occur secondary to other lesions. They may occur as the
result of the degeneration and softening of bone sarcomata.
Some of the cases of bone cysts undoubtedly represent the
entire destruction of sarcomatous processes. Occasionally
echinococcus cysts of bone occur.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Cysts of bone due to softening of the
centre of sarcomatous tumors, like sarcomata themselves,
are to be treated by complete removal, best usually by
amputation. Cysts of bone not due to the presence of
sarcomatous tissue, should be opened and drained in some
cases. Cysts due to the presence of echinococcus, should be
opened and drained, with the removal of every vestige of
the echinococcus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><b>DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE
ARTERIES AND GANGRENE</b></h3>

<p><b>Gangrene</b> is a term employed to denote the death of a
part of the body, in mass.</p>

<p><i>Necrosis</i> and <i>mortification</i> are terms used in a similar
sense though necrosis is reserved in surgery to mean death
of bone.</p>

<p>Gangrene may result from the gradual or sudden cessation
of the arterial supply, or from a stoppage of the venous
outflow. In general the etiology of gangrene comprises:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. Traumatic causes.</div>
<div class="line">2. Constitutional causes.</div>
<div class="line">3. Thrombosis and embolism.</div>
<div class="line">4. Cold.</div>
<div class="line">5. The effect of certain chemicals.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Before entering into a consideration of these subjects,
it is wise to first consider the varieties of gangrene.</p>

<p>There are two forms in which gangrene is observed:
<i>dry</i> and <i>moist</i>.</p>

<p><b>Dry gangrene</b>, or mummification, is a condition which
occurs in consequence of a gradual diminution and final
cessation of the blood supply, with the venous outflow
intact. In this way, aided by evaporation and the venous
return, there is a gradual drying of the parts. Diseases
of the arteries and increasing pressure upon them from
growing tumors, causes this variety.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Moist gangrene</b> is due to the sudden arrest of the
arterial supply, or a similar obstruction to the venous
return.</p>

<p>This is the variety commonly met with from crushing
or cutting accidents; from the effects of carbolic and other
acids; from cold; and from thrombosis and embolism.</p>

<p>A <i>thrombus</i> is a blood clot occluding the lumen of a
vessel. An <i>embolus</i> is a loosened part of a thrombus or
any other foreign substance, free in the blood stream, such
as a drop of fat, an air globule, or a detached particle of
tissue from growths in the heart or vessels. Any one of
these may find lodgment in a terminal vessel, and plug it.</p>

<p>Moist gangrene therefore differs from dry gangrene in
that the arrest of circulation takes place more or less suddenly
when the tissues are suffused with blood.</p>

<p>The dry form of gangrene does not occur regularly in
the diseases in which it might be expected, and though a
true wet gangrene is not found, neither is the typical mummification.</p>

<p>Moist gangrene may occur in diabetes, in senility and
in Reynaud&#8217;s disease, and probably assumes this form on
account of the sudden onset of inflammation in the part
from some slight abrasion, or from weak heart action.</p>

<h4><b>CAUSES OF GANGRENE</b></h4>

<p><i>Traumatic.</i> The sudden cessation of the blood supply
to a part in consequence of a cutting or crushing accident,
will obviously produce the moist form of gangrene. It is
not essential that the part be entirely severed, or even
nearly so, for if only the main artery is severed, gangrene
will ensue.</p>

<p>The crushing or pressure upon a large vein will act
similarly, owing to there being no outflow possible, back
pressure will cause the total arrest of circulation in the
part.</p>

<p><i>Constitutional Diseases.</i> Certain diseases affect the
lumen or calibre of the blood vessels, gradually diminishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and finally arresting the stream of blood carried through
them.</p>

<p>In these diseases it would be logical to invariably
expect dry gangrene. This does not regularly occur, for
the reason just given, and the mere presence of a moist or
dry condition therefore cannot be regarded as diagnostic.</p>

<p>In diabetes, either form may obtain, and a diagnosis
can be assured by the discovery of sugar in the urine.</p>

<p>The thickened condition of the arteries leading to senile
gangrene must be thought of and proven in aged subjects.
Dry gangrene is the rule in arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p>Reynaud&#8217;s disease, or synthetic gangrene, is due to a
vasomotor spasmodic condition of the terminal vessels and
is of central nerve origin. The tips of the toes and fingers,
of both sides, are the most common sites, though the lobes
of the ears, cheeks and tip of the nose may be affected.</p>

<p>A coldness of the parts, with mottling of blue and
white, and a subsequent diffuse blueness, becoming darker
and finally black, are characteristic signs of this disease,
and the dry form of gangrene is usual.</p>

<p><i>Obliterating Endarteritis</i>, is a condition in which the
walls of an artery become inflamed and thickened, thus
obliterating its lumen.</p>

<p><i>Thromboangiitis Obliterans</i> is similar to the above and
differs only in that a thrombotic growth occurs in an artery
obliterating its lumen.</p>

<p><i>Thrombosis and Embolism.</i> Thrombosis and embolism
cause a sudden or gradual stoppage of the blood stream
in a vessel, and in consequence, either moist or dry gangrene
occurs, depending on the time required for the
obstruction to become complete.</p>

<p>The stoppage of the outflow because of thrombosis in
a large vein, will cause moist gangrene; the part being
unable to drain, will, by back pressure, arrest circulation.</p>

<p><i>Cold.</i> Frost bite causes gangrene of varying degrees.
A small circumscribed patch of tissue may succumb, or an
entire finger or extremity may be affected. The variety is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
invariably moist. The diagnosis is easily made from the
history of exposure (See &#8220;Frost bite&#8221;).</p>

<p><i>Chemicals.</i> Carbolic acid, even in weak solution, often
causes gangrene of a finger or toe, because of its frequent
use as a wet dressing, and therefore should never be
employed in this manner. Gangrene of a single part,
(especially in a young subject), incident to a slight injury
or infection, should always excite suspicion that phenol has
been employed. Moist gangrene is the rule. The part
presents a hard, shriveled, black appearance which is characteristic.</p>

<p>Weak solutions of other chemicals such as lysol, acetic
acid, and potassium or sodium hydroxide, employed as a
wet dressing, are also capable of producing gangrene.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> (<i>Dry Gangrene</i>). Typical dry gangrene
usually develops in the toes and the feet, and the principal
symptoms which point to its advent are, coldness, numbness,
pain and tingling in the feet and muscles of the legs.
Persons about to be affected with dry gangrene often complain
for months, before any local signs of gangrene are
present, of severe burning pain in the feet at night when
warm in bed.</p>

<p>A trivial injury, such as a bruise, the friction of the
shoe, or the cutting of a corn, may act as the exciting cause
of the affection. The part becomes congested and gradually
assumes a dark purple color, finally becoming black and
dry; it is insensitive, but the surrounding parts are congested
and may be the seat of intense pain. The dead part
becomes black, shriveled, and dry, and emits little odor.</p>

<p>Dry gangrene usually spreads very slowly; one or two
toes may first be involved and the disease may gradually
spread to the rest of the foot and the leg. There may be
little fever at first, but if a large extent of tissue is involved,
a certain amount of fever develops. During the progress
of the disease, pain is usually present to a greater or lesser
degree, sometimes being intense; this is accounted for by
the fact that the nerves are usually the last structures to die.</p>

<p>During the course of the disease, the patient loses much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
sleep from continued pain, and becomes worn out and
may die of exhaustion.</p>

<p>In dry gangrene there is usually no well marked
attempt at the formation of lines of demarcation and
separation, but in some cases, if the amount of tissue
involved is small, say one or two toes, or a part of the foot,
for instance, and if the patient&#8217;s strength can be sustained,
the line of separation forms, and the dead tissue may be
cast off, leaving the bones exposed in the wound.</p>

<p><b>Moist Gangrene.</b> When a part which has had its
vitality seriously interfered with becomes gangrenous, pain,
which may have been present, suddenly ceases, the part
becomes insensitive, and the skin is cold, pale, and mottled
purple, green, and red, and finally dark colored; blebs containing
brownish serum form upon the surface; the wound,
if one is present, assumes a grayish color, and an offensive
discharge escapes from it; the dead tissue rapidly undergoes
putrefactive changes. Coincidentally with these
changes in the dead tissues, the living tissue in contact with
it becomes red and swollen, and the separation of the dead
tissue from the living is affected by an ulcerative inflammation,
granulations from the living tissue lifting off the
slough.</p>

<p>The patient, at the same time, if the gangrenous process
involves any considerable extent of surface, exhibits
the unconstitutional signs of inflammation (fever, rapid pulse,
etc.) and, in some cases, if the septic infection is intense,
may die from septicemia.</p>

<p>In both dry and moist gangrene, when the gangrenous
process is arrested, the dead tissue is separated from the
living by a process of inflammation; the living tissue, at
its point of contact with the dead tissue, and for some distance
from it, becomes red and swollen, and exhibits all the
signs of acute inflammation. The line of contact between
the dead and the living tissue is known as <i>the line of demarcation</i>,
and the line of granulations which separates the
dead tissue from the living, is known as <i>the line of separation</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The separation of the dead tissue is affected by granulations,
which spring up from the living tissue as a result
of inflammation, and there is also a certain amount of pus
secreted from the granulations. In moist gangrene, the
lines of demarcation and separation are fairly well developed.
In dry gangrene, on the other hand, these lines
are usually imperfectly developed.</p>

<p><b>Early Diagnosis.</b> From the foregoing it will be observed
that gangrene is most common in those past middle life, and
that its actual onset is only a stage in an insidious process.
This may be either due to senility or to some constitutional
disease. A slight abrasion alone is sufficient to set up a
train of symptoms out of all proportion to the cause. In
such a case, the operation of a small verruca or papilloma
may be followed by a violent inflammatory reaction, with
rapid extension into the entire foot or leg, resulting in
gangrene.</p>

<p>Such cases have occurred, but could have been prevented
if a proper survey of the field had been taken and
would have saved the chiropodist much responsibility.</p>

<p>Before operating on subjects past middle life, it should
be a routine practice to note the color and temperature of
the foot, both in the dependent and horizontal positions.
The <i>anterior tibial pulse</i> should also be felt for and its
absence or intensity noted. A question to the patient as to
diabetes or thickened arteries may also elicit valuable
information. A very weak or absent anterior tibial pulse
(the knack of feeling the pulse here must be acquired), or
peculiar nodules about the nail grooves, are evidences of
an encumbered arterial supply.</p>

<p>Extreme redness or blueness in a foot in the hanging
position, and pallor when elevated, also indicate a similar
condition, or one in which the valves in the veins are impaired.</p>

<p>It is in such conditions that the greatest care should be
taken to avoid deep incisions except in the presence of positive
indications.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In general, amputation through healthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
tissue is the rule in gangrene affecting any extremity
through its entire thickness. The complete devitalization of
even a digital phalanx requires that amputation be made
beyond the next joint above.</p>

<p>In traumatic gangrene it is the rule to amputate immediately
through healthy tissue when restitution of the
injured parts is known to be impossible. In senile gangrene
the appearance of the line of demarcation indicates the extent
of the devitalized area and establishes the point of
amputation beyond the next joint above.</p>

<p>Diabetic gangrene presents the peculiarity of a slow
and steady advance, unless an unusually high amputation
be performed. Thus, if the great toe is the site of the beginning
of a true diabetic gangrene, amputation through
the lower third of the thigh is indicated; otherwise the
prognosis is very bad.</p>

<p>Inflammatory gangrene, or as it is more properly called
<i>gangrenous cellulitis</i>, is a rapidly spreading infective process
which destroys tissue as it advances. It is an acute
suppurative process causing large sloughs. It is a form of
cellulitis requiring drainage and disinfection.</p>

<p>Frost bite may involve tissues to any depth and to any
surface extent. Lesions of circumscribed contour result in
the sloughing away of the area involved and never require
amputation. (See &#8220;Frost bite.&#8221;)</p>

<p>In the event of a phalanx, toe, finger, foot, or hand
being involved, the same rules as above laid down must
apply. In this variety, however, it is important to allow
sufficient time to elapse in order that the depth of the
gangrenous process may be ascertained. Should the line
of demarcation be apparent, after a few days the complete
death of the tissues below is certain, and amputation becomes
necessary. If, however, after a few days some slight
bleeding or the appearance of a red point be apparent, the
bone, and in all probability some tissue around it, is still
viable. Haste in these cases should therefore be avoided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><b>DISEASES OF VEINS</b></h3>

<p>Varicose veins are unnatural, irregular, and permanently
dilated veins which elongate and pursue a tortuous
course. This condition is very common, and twenty per
cent. of adults exhibit it in some degree in one region or
another.</p>

<p>The causes of varicose veins are obstruction to venous
return, and weakness of cardiac action, which lessens the
propulsion of the blood stream.</p>

<p>Varicose veins may occur in any portion of the body,
but are chiefly met with on the inner side of the lower extremity.</p>

<p>Varix in the leg is met with during and after pregnancy,
and in persons who stand upon their feet for long
periods.</p>

<p>It especially appears in the long saphenous vein, which,
being subcutaneous, has no muscular aid in supporting the
blood-column and in urging it on. The deep as well as the
superficial veins may become varicose.</p>

<p>Varicose veins are in rare instances congenital; they
are most often seen in the aged, but usually begin at the
ages of twenty to forty.</p>

<p>A vein, under pressure, usually dilates more at one
spot than at another, the distention being greatest back of
a valve or near the mouth of a tributary. The valves become
incompetent and the dilatation becomes still greater.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
The vein wall may become fibrous, but usually it is thin, and
ruptures. The veins not only dilate, but they also become
longer, and hence do not remain straight but twist and turn
into a characteristic form.</p>

<p>Varicose veins are apt to cause edema, and the watery
elements in the tissues cause eczema of the skin. When
eczema is once inaugurated, excoriation is to be expected.
Infection of the excoriated area produces inflammation,
suppuration, and an ulcer.</p>

<p>The skin over varicose veins in the legs is often discolored
by pigmentation due to the red cells having escaped
from the vessel and then being broken up.</p>

<p>The tissues around a varicose vein become atrophied
from pressure, and often a very large vein will be in evidence
whose thin walls are in close contact with the skin,
and in this condition, rupture and hemorrhage are probable.
Varicose veins are apt to inflame and thrombosis frequently
occurs.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment of varix may be palliative
or curative, but whichever is followed, endeavor first to
remove the cause.</p>

<p>In palliative treatment, attend to the general health,
keep up the force and activity of the circulation, and prevent
constipation. Recommend the patient to exercise in
the open air and to lie down, if possible, every afternoon.
Locally, in varix of the leg, order a flannel bandage to support
the vein and drive the blood into the deeper vessels
which have muscular support. (For technic, see chapter
on bandaging).</p>

<p>The curative or operative treatment of varicose veins
consists of performing a resection of the internal saphenous
vein of one or two inches, near the saphenous opening into
the femoral. This is known as the <i>Trendelenburg</i> method.
About 90 per cent of all cases can be cured by this method.
The operation can be performed under local anesthesia and
presents no difficulties.</p>

<p>Another procedure is known as <i>Schede&#8217;s</i> method. This
consists of making a circular incision around the leg just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
below the knee joint, and in tying all the superficial veins
thus exposed.</p>

<p><i>Mayo&#8217;s</i> operation consists of the total extirpation of
the internal saphenous vein from the saphenous opening
to the internal malleolus. A small incision is made high
up, and at a distance of from 8 to 10 inches, a second incision
is made, and in this manner the entire vein is removed
by making several incisions.</p>

<p>The patient should remain in bed about three weeks
following an operation of this kind and afterwards an elastic
stocking, or an ideal bandage, should be worn for a
considerable time.</p>

<p><b>Phlebitis</b>, or inflammation of a vein, may be plastic or
purulent in nature. Plastic phlebitis, while occasionally
due to gout, or to some other constitutional condition,
usually arises from a wound or other injury, from the extension
to the vein of a perivascular inflammation, or, in
the portal region, from an embolus.</p>

<p>Varicose veins are particularly liable to phlebitis.
When phlebitis begins, a thrombus forms because of the
destruction of the endothelial coat, and this clot may be
absorbed or organized.</p>

<p><b>Suppurative Phlebitis</b> is a suppurative inflammation of
the vein, arising by infection from suppurating perivascular
tissues (<i>infective thrombophlebitis</i>). It is most frequently
met with in cellulitis or phlegmonous erysipelas, but there
are a great many other causes.</p>

<p>A thrombus forms, the vein wall suppurates, is softened
and in part destroyed, and the clot becomes purulent.
No bleeding occurs when the vein ruptures, as a barrier of
clot keeps back the blood stream. The clot of suppurative
phlebitis cannot be absorbed and cannot organize.</p>

<p>Septic phlebitis causes pyemia, and the infected clots
of pyemia cause phlebitis. The symptoms of phlebitis are
pain, which is at once felt in the limb along the track of the
inflamed vein, and tenderness along the same area; the overlying
skin is red, hot, and tender, and the lymphatic nodes
in the groin swell; there is marked edema, but the inflamed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
venous cords can be readily felt. The constitutional disturbance
is marked; rigors and high temperature, 103&deg;F.
to 105&deg;F. (remittent type), are followed by profuse sweats.
The general condition, facies and anxiety, dry and parched
tongue, delirium and general distress, at once directs attention
to the infectious nature of the trouble. The leucocyte
count will show a marked increase in the number of
polynuclears.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment of phlebitis may be classified
into preventive and curative, the latter being subdivided
into (<i>a</i>), general or symptomatic, and (<i>b</i>), local or surgical.</p>

<p>The preventive treatment is summed up in the word
asepsis. The influence of asepsis in the management of
wounds has completely revolutionized surgical practice,
and the old fatal types of pyemia and septicema have now
practically vanished.</p>

<p>Septic and pyogenic phlebitis still remain as consequences
of accidental wound contaminations and as a penalty
for the neglect of surgical cleanliness.</p>

<p>Prophylatic measures, by the use of internal remedies
which diminish the coagulability of the blood, such as
Wright&#8217;s citric acid treatment, are recommended for the
prevention of thrombosis. Antitoxins have not proven to be
of benefit in this condition.</p>

<p>The curative treatment may be symptomatic, local, constitutional,
or surgical. The constitutional treatment is
directed to the general cause, if possible, as in the gouty,
rheumatic, syphilitic, and chloritic cases; beyond this, there
is no specific treatment. The antistreptococcal and staphylococcal
sera are usually prescribed in the septic forms,
but thus far, more as a forlorn hope than with the expectation
of accomplishing any definite results. The symptomatic
treatment, on the other hand, is always indicated to
diminish pain, to support and strengthen the circulation,
and to favor elimination. The main reliance is to be placed
upon the local treatment, combined with good nursing, appropriate
food, and moderate stimulation.</p>

<p>The local treatment is summed up in the following indications:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
(<i>a</i>), immobilization and absolute rest of the affected
limb; (<i>b</i>), elevated position of the foot of the bed or
of the limb to favor the drainage of the venous current toward
the trunk. The limb should be covered with cotton
batting and bandaged, over a gutter-splint of cardboard, extending
from the foot to the thigh, to immobilize the knee.
In the superficial inflammations, with much redness and
heat, an even layer of any of the kaolin mixtures may be
applied between thin layers of gauze, like an antiseptic
poultice, over the entire extremity, and especially over the
inflamed parts. A saturated watery solution of 25 per cent.
ichthyol, painted over the entire surface will also prove decidedly
beneficial in cases complicated with lymphangitis.
Unguentum Crede, mercurial ointment, and the so-called
resolvent lotions have been tried, but none of these can compare
in their beneficial effect with kaolin poultices, with or
without ichthyol, or the liberal application of broad compresses,
thoroughly saturated with a weak lead and opium
lotion, which latter acts not only as a local astringent, but
as a marked sedative. Immobilization and rest should be
maintained for a month or more.</p>

<p><b>Operative Treatment.</b> The operative treatment of
acute septic thrombophlebitis has in view three indications,
and the procedures adopted must vary according to these:
(1) ligation of the vein between the thrombotic focus and
the uninfected vein on the cardiac side, in order to obstruct
the further advance of the infection, and thus prevent the
entrance of septic emboli into the circulation; (2) removal
of the primary focus of infection by direct incision into the
veins, evacuation of the septic thrombus and drainage; (3)
extirpation of the infected veins with the contained clot and
septic contents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><b>SPECIAL FORMS OF INFLAMMATION</b></h3>

<p><b>Syphilis</b> is a chronic, infectious, and sometimes hereditary,
constitutional disease. Its first lesion is an infecting
area or chancre, which is followed by lymphatic enlargements;
eruptions upon the skin and mucous membranes;
affections of the appendages of the skin, (hair and nails);
chronic inflammation and infiltration of the cellulo-vascular
tissue, bones and periosteum, and later, often by gummata.
This disease is caused by a microorganism known as the
<i>spirochaeta pallida</i> or <i>treponema pallidum</i> of Schaudinn
and Hoffmann.</p>

<p><b>Transmission of Syphilis.</b> This disease can be transmitted
(<i>a</i>), by contact with the tissue-elements or virus acquired
syphilis, and (<i>b</i>), by hereditary transmission, hereditary
syphilis.</p>

<p>The poison cannot enter through an intact epidermis or
epithelial layer; an abrasion or solution of continuity is
requisite for infection.</p>

<p>Syphilis is usually, but not always, a venereal disease.
It may be caught by infection of the genitals during coition;
by infection of the tongue or lips in kissing; by the use of
an infected towel on an abraded surface; by smoking poisoned
pipes, and by drinking out of infected vessels.</p>

<p>The initial lesion of syphilis may be found on the finger,
penis, eyelid, lip, tongue, cheek, palate, nipple, etc. Syphilis
can be transmitted by vaccination with human lymph which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
contains the pus of a syphilitic eruption or the blood of a
syphilitic person. Syphilis is divided into three stages
(1) the primary stage&#8212;chancre and indolent bubo; (2) the
secondary stage&#8212;disease of the upper layer of the skin
and mucous membranes, and (3) the tertiary stage&#8212;affections
of connective tissues, bones, fibrous and serous membranes,
and parenchymatous organs.</p>

<p><b>Syphilitic Periods.</b> (1) period of primary incubation&#8212;the
time between exposure and the appearance of the
chancre, from ten to ninety days, the average time being
three weeks; (2) period of primary symptoms&#8212;chancre and
bubo of adjacent lymph glands; (3) period of secondary
incubation&#8212;the time between the appearance of the chancre
and the advent of secondary symptoms,&#8212;about six weeks
as a rule; (4) period of secondary symptoms&#8212;lasting from
one to three years; (5) intermediate period&#8212;there may be
no symptoms or there may be light symptoms which are less
symmetrical and more general than those of the secondary
period; it lasts from two to four years, and ends in recovery
or tertiary syphilis; and (6) period of tertiary symptoms&#8212;indefinite
in duration; the fifth and sixth may never occur,
the disease being cured.</p>

<p><b>Primary Syphilis.</b> The primary stage comprises the
chancre or infecting sore or bubo. A chancre or initial
lesion is an infective granuloma resulting from the poison
of syphilis. The chancre appears at the point of inoculation,
and is the first lesion of the disease. During the three
weeks or more requisite to develop a chancre the poison is
continuously entering the system, and when the chancre develops,
the system already contains a large amount of
poison.</p>

<p>A chancre is not a local lesion from which syphilis
springs, but is a local manifestation of an existing constitutional
disease, hence excision is entirely useless. The
hard chancre, or initial lesion, never appears before the
tenth day after exposure, it may not appear for weeks, but
it usually arises in about twenty-one days. The lesion commonly
appears as a round, indurated, cartilaginous area
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
with an elevated edge, which ulcerates, exposing a velvety
surface looking like raw ham; it bleeds easily, rarely suppurates,
does not spread, and the discharge is thin and
watery.</p>

<p>The bubo of syphilis is multiple, consisting of a chain
of glands, freely movable, indurated, painless, small and
slow in growth, and the skin over the bubo is normal.</p>

<p>A positive diagnosis of syphilis can be made when an
indurated sore is followed by multiple indolent glands or
buboes in the groin and by the enlargement of distant
glands.</p>

<p><b>Secondary Glands.</b> The symptoms are noticed from
four to six weeks after the stage of the induration of the
chancre, and may continue to appear at any time, up to
twelve months. The most constant are certain eruptions on
the skin, faucial inflammation, and enlargement or induration
of the lymphatic glands; others are febrile reaction,
pains in the back or limbs, swelling of the joints, iritis and
falling out of the hair.</p>

<p><b>Tertiary Syphilis.</b> These symptoms appear from one
to two years after contagion and may continue to break
out from ten to fifteen years, or more. The characteristic
lesions are certain late eruptions on the skin, periostitis
and nodes on the bones, and growths in the subcutaneous
tissue, muscle, and viscera, especially the liver and spleen.
These growths, in the viscera and other parts, which are
so characteristic of syphilis in its later stages, are known
as gummata. They consist of a substance like granulation
tissue, with a varying proportion of cells. In early stages
they are grayish, gelatinous, and transparent, but the cells
undergo fatty change and caseation takes place, so that the
centre becomes yellow, and the circumference develops into
fibrous tissue, which contracts like a scar tissue. Sometimes
gummata break down completely, and suppuration,
with destruction of the tissues in which they are situated,
takes place; thus caries and necrosis not infrequently follow
nodes on the bones.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Mercury is the drug of great benefit in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
syphilis. This can be administered either internally, by
inunction, or by injection. Of all the preparations to be
given internally, protiodide of mercury, in one quarter grain
doses, three times a day, is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b>Inunction</b> represents the most efficient way of administering
the mercurial treatment, when the stomach is intolerant
of drugs, or when administered by the mouth in
full doses, they do not favorably modify the symptoms.
The patient is instructed to take a warm bath, and the
mercury is then well rubbed in over the inner surface of the
forearm and arm and alongside of the chest for fifteen minutes.
Either the oleate of mercury, 10 per cent., or the
ordinary mercury ointment is commonly employed; the
former is more clean, but less efficient. The rubbings should
be done by the patient, should be made over a large surface
of the body, and should be performed thoroughly; one
dram (4.0) of blue ointment is rubbed in daily. For the
injections, a 10 per cent. salicylate of mercury in olive oil
is to be preferred; 10 to 15 minums of this solution is to
be injected into the buttocks, three times a week. The dose
is gradually to be increased until 30 drops are employed.
Recently salvarsan (606) in 0.6, or 10 grain doses is given
either intravenously or intraspinally. Neosalvarsan (914)
is to be similarly given. The latter has the advantage in
that sterile water is used, and that, as a rule, there is no
reaction from its injection. Iodide of potassium in large
doses (60 to 90 grains) three times a day, is also to be given.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis.</b> Tuberculosis is an infectious disease due
to the deposition and multiplication of the tubercule bacillus
in the tissues of the body. It is characterized either
by the formation of tubercules, or by a wide spread infiltration,
both of these conditions tending to caseation, sclerosis,
or ulceration.</p>

<p>A tubercular lesion may undergo calcification.</p>

<p>A tubercule is an infective granuloma, appearing to the
unaided vision as a semitransparent mass, gray in color,
and the size of a mustard seed.</p>

<p>The microscope shows that a tubercule consists of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
number of cell clusters, each cluster consisting of one or of
several polynucleated giant cells, surrounded by a zone of
epitheloid cells which are surrounded by an area of leucocytes.
Giant cells, which also form by coalescence of the
epithelioid cells, are not always present. The bacillus, when
found, exists in the epithelioid cells, and sometimes in the
giant cells; it may not be found, having once existed, but
having been subsequently destroyed. It is often overlooked.</p>

<p>In an active tubercular lesion, even if the bacillus be
not found, injection of the matter into a guinea-pig will
produce lesions in which it can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>A tubercule may caseate, a process that is destructive
and dangerous to the organism. Caseation forms cheesy
masses, which may soften into tubercular pus, may calcify,
and may become encapsulated by fibroid tissue. Tubercular
disease of the bones and joints have already been described
in a previous chapter.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Destroy the bacilli present and radically
remove infected areas which are accessible. Incomplete operations
are apt to be followed by diffuse tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Bier&#8217;s venous or obstructive hyperemia is especially to
be recommended in tuberculosis of the ankle joint (for technic,
see chapter on Therapeutics).</p>

<p>Plenty of fresh air, good nourishing food and tonics
are indicated as a routine treatment.</p>

<p><b>Tetanus.</b> Tetanus is an infectious disease, invariably
preceded by some injury. The wound may have been severe
or it may have been so slight as to have attracted no
attention.</p>

<p>The disease is commonest after punctured wounds or
lacerated ones of the hands or feet, and before it appears,
a wound is apt to suppurate or slough, but in some instances
the wound is found soundly healed.</p>

<p>Tetanus is due to infection by a bacillus (first described
by Nicolaier, and first cultivated by Kitasato), the
toxic properties of which, absorbed from the infected area,
poison the nervous system precisely as would dosing with
strychnine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The onset is usually within nine days of
an accident. At first, the neck feels stiff and there is difficulty
in swallowing, and then the jaw also becomes stiff.
The neck becomes like an iron bar, and the jaws are rigid
as steel. If the injury is on the foot, that extremity usually
is found to be rigid. Opisthotonos is present and spasms
are very marked. Swallowing in many cases is impossible.
The mind is entirely clear until near the end, one of the
worst elements of the disease.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Careful antisepsis will banish it. Every
wound must be disinfected with the most scrupulous care.
Every punctured wound is to be incised to its depth and
thoroughly cleaned and drained. Large doses of the bromide
of potassium, at least sixty grains, should be given
every four to six hours. Tetanus antitoxin should be given
(5000 units), and repeated in twenty-four hours if no improvement
is seen. Recently a saturated solution of magnesium
sulphate has been given intraspinally, with very
good results. In all suspicious cases, a prophylatic injection
of tetanus antitoxin is to be recommended (1000 units).</p>

<p><b>Erysipelas.</b> Erysipelas is an acute, contagious disease,
characterized by a peculiar form of inflammation of the
skin. It is caused by the streptococcus of erysipelas, which
grows and multiplies in the smaller lymph channels of the
skin and its subcutaneous cellular layers, and in serous and
mucous membranes.</p>

<p>The disease is a rapid spreading dermatitis, accompanied
by a remittent fever, due to the absorption of toxins,
having a tendency to recur. It is always due to a wound.
The involved area may or may not suppurate.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The onset is sudden, with a high fever, and
at the time of febrile onset, spots of redness appear on the
skin. These spots run together, and a large extent of surface
is found to be red and a little elevated. This combination
of redness and swelling extends, and its area is
sharply defined from the healthy skin. The color at once
fades on pressure and returns immediately the pressure is
removed. In the hyperemic area, vesicles or bullae form,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
containing first serum and later possibly sero-pus. Edema
affects the subcutaneous tissues, producing great swelling
in the regions where these tissues are lax.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Isolate the patient; asepticize the wound;
and give a purge. If a person is debilitated, stimulate
freely.</p>

<p>Tincture of iron and quinine are usually administered.
Nutritious food is important. For sleeplessness or delirium,
use the bromides; for light temperature, cold sponging
and antipyretics. Locally, strict antiseptic treatment of
existing wounds or other lesions; cold compresses to relax
the skin; rest; elevation of the limb; and incisions, only if
pus forms.</p>

<p>Where the disease is spreading, good results are obtained
by spraying the affected surface with a weak solution
of corrosive sublimate in ether, or painting the borders
of the affected area with contractile collodion. The affected
part may also be painted with a 50 per cent. ichthyol
and water solution. Alcohol, Burow&#8217;s solution, and a great
many other liquid applications are recommended. Antistreptococci
serum is also to be recommended; an initial
dose of 20 c.c. followed by doses of 10 c.c., as often as necessary,
being the usual procedure.</p>

<p><b>Cellulitis.</b> In cellulitis, redness of the skin is not very
pronounced and is late in appearing, following swelling, and
not preceding it. It is essentially the same condition as a
mild form of erysipelas. Its spread is heralded by red
lines of lymphangitis, ascending from a wound (infected),
swelling of glands, and fever.</p>

<p>In slight cases, the lymphatics may dispose of the poison,
and suppuration fails to occur. In severe cases septicema
arises. Cellulitis is usually a result of infection not
only with streptococci, but also with other pyogenic cocci.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Incise and curet the wound and apply one
of the wet dressings. (See chapter on same).</p>

<p><b>Actinomycosis.</b> This is an infectious disease characterized
by chronic inflammation, and is due to the presence
in the tissues of the actinomyces, or ray fungus. At the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
point of inoculation arises an infective granuloma, around
which inflammation of connective tissues occurs; suppuration
eventually taking place. Inoculation in the mouth is
by way of an abrasion of mucous membrane or through a
carious tooth. The fungi may pass into the bones and
joints, causing inflammation of the parts. The bones in
actinomycosis enlarge and become painful; the parts adjacent
are infiltrated and soften; pus forms and reaches the
surface through fistulae and the skin is often involved secondarily.
In actinomycosis the adjacent lymphatic glands
are not involved.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Free incision, if possible, otherwise incision,
cauterizing with pure carbolic acid, and packing with
iodoform gauze. Internally, large doses of iodide of potassium
should be given, as this drug alone has cured many
cases.</p>

<p><b>Trench Foot.</b> This results from exposure to wet and
cold in the trenches, and soldiers who were compelled to
have their feet immersed in water for any length of time
and were then exposed to cold, are afflicted with this condition.
The symptoms are similar to frost bite and the
prevention of frigorism (Trench Foot) is as follows: adequate
feeding; perfect circulation; moderate exercise; good
general health; and warm clothing, which all tend to give
the body its maximum power of resistance to cold.</p>

<p>It is obvious that anything that tends to impair the
circulation and the nutrition of the tissues is favorable to
the occurrence of frigorism. Tightness of the clothing of
the extremities, such as tight boots, leggins, etc., is particularly
detrimental. Heavy clothing and other equipment,
by increasing fatigue, also has a predisposing influence.</p>

<p>With regard to the protection against cold water, it is
necessary that the external covering should be impervious
to and not affected by water. India rubber stockings,
waders, and boots have been used by men working in water,
not only as a protection against wet, but also against cold.
The best results have been obtained by the use of a waterproof
covering that can be worn inside the boot, not because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
it is the only, or even the best possible method, but
because it appears to be the simplest and most practical.
A waterproof top boot, so devised as to leave a fairly wide
air space between the boot and the greater part of the foot,
ankle, and lower part of the leg, would be more efficient
and probably more convenient, provided the material used
was soft and light, and did not interfere with movements.
To obtain this result a new type of boot would be required.</p>

<p>The treatment of trench foot is similar to that of frost
bite.</p>

<p><b>Motorman&#8217;s Foot.</b> This is a condition caused by occupation,
and the symptoms found are usually those of a flat
foot combined with enlarged veins. The chief complaint is
that of pain in the calf of the legs, which is increased upon
standing for any length of time. The treatment is that for
flat foot and enlarged veins.</p>

<p><b>Chauffeur&#8217;s Foot.</b> This is a condition also caused by
occupation. On account of the position assumed in driving
an automobile, the tendons and muscles of the leg are
usually affected and a tendosynovitis very frequently occurs.
The symptoms and treatment have already been described.
Rest is without doubt the best therapeutic measure.</p>

<p><b>Bicycle Foot</b> is another occupational disease. The chief
symptoms are those of cramps in the calves of the leg, and
pains of a severe neuritic character.</p>

<p>At times the onset is very sudden, and the cramps are
so severe that it is impossible to extend the leg without
causing great pain. Flat foot is usually associated with the
above condition. The treatment is rest and the administration
of the salicylates for the relief of pain.</p>

<p>Bicycling is ordinarily a beneficial exercise for the foot
muscles. When bicycle foot results from this exercise it is
usually evidence that the bicyclist had an abnormal condition
of his foot muscles and foot joints before he took up
the exercise in question.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><b>VERRUCA (WART), CALLOSITY,
HELOMA (CORN OR CLAVUS)</b></h3>

<h4><b>DISEASES OF THE NAILS&#8212;INGROWN
NAIL</b></h4>

<h4><b>VERRUCA OR WART</b></h4>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A verruca is a circumscribed overgrowth of
all the layers of the skin, varying in size from a pin&#8217;s head
to a small nut. These growths may be single or multiple,
and may come and go without any special reason. <i>Verruca
plantaris</i>, or plantar wart, is observed on the sole of the
foot; it may be single or multiple. It is very painful; it
may be the size of a pea and is often mistaken for a callosity,
from which it may be distinguished by the pain on pressure,
and the tendency to bleed when the horny layer is removed.</p>

<p>Verrucae are probably contagious, but the pathogenic
agent has not been isolated. They sometimes disappear
spontaneously, and they will recur if their removal is not
complete.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Certain chemical substances (see &#8220;<i>escharotics</i>&#8221;)
destroy tissue and can be employed with safety only
after much experience. These drugs when allowed to spread
on the normal skin often occasion painful and persistent
lesions. They must therefore be applied directly and sparingly
to the growth itself and not be left in contact too long.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The daily removal of a thin layer is possible in this way
without causing pain or erosion.</p>

<p>The chemical agents that are employed for the removal
of verruca are notably nitric acid, acetic acid, monochloracetic
acid, trichloracetic acid, nitrate of silver, sodium hydroxide
and salicylic acid. The treatment with these drugs
is alike in all cases, with the exception of the last three
named.</p>

<p>The procedure, when using liquid acids is as follows:
render the growth and the surrounding parts aseptic; by
means of a tapering glass rod or a wooden toothpick, apply
a drop of the acid so that it will spread over the growth
only, making certain that every part of the outer surface
has been treated. If pain becomes excessive, apply a
neutralizing agent. Dress the part with a shield that is
holed-out, so that when the foot-covering is in place there
will be no pressure over the tissues treated. This treatment
should be repeated every other day until there is sloughing
at the base of the growth. The pocket produced is drained,
and balsam of Peru or some other stimulant should be
applied and held in place by an appropriate dressing. Five
or six treatments will ordinarily suffice to remove the
growth.</p>

<p>Many practitioners find nitrate of silver a serviceable
remedy in cases of verruca. The pure stick, moistened,
is gently applied to the surface of the growth, which later
becomes blackened. The patient returns two days later
when the scab, that will have formed, is removed and the
original treatment is repeated. Ordinarily from six to ten
such applications will suffice. Those who favor the use of
salicylic acid for the removal of verruca, usually apply a
60 per cent. ointment of this drug, over the growth only,
protecting the surrounding parts with collodion or gelatine.
A holed-out shield is applied over the growth and an appropriate
bandage is made to hold it and the ointment in place.
The patient is advised to return at the end of ten days and,
as a rule, when the dressing is removed, it will be found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that the growth is sufficiently loosened to admit of removal
by means of forceps and scissors.</p>

<p>Sodium hydroxide is used in these cases in a saturated
solution. It is best applied by means of a wood toothpick,
wound about with cotton, and should be used sparingly,
much after the manner in which liquid acid applications are
made and as above described. A slight stinging sensation
indicates that the drug has penetrated the tissues near the
nerve-endings in the underlying papillae. Such symptoms
render it necessary to neutralize the sodium hydroxide.
According to Dr. Joseph Renk of New York City, ordinary
vinegar contains just the degree of acidity necessary to
neutralize the action of the sodium hydroxide, without adding
a new irritating element.</p>

<p>Verrucae may also be removed by the high frequency
spark, or by electrolysis. Both of these methods are superior
to cutting operations, but are equally as painful unless
a drop of anesthetic solution is injected into the base
of the growth, before treatment is commenced.</p>

<h4><b>CALLOSITY</b></h4>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A callosity is a circumscribed thickening of
the <i>stratum cornium</i>. The condition is usually acquired,
occurring on parts exposed to intermittent pressure with
counterpressure from an underlying bony prominence, as
on the toes, soles, and heel of the foot, from ill-fitting shoes.</p>

<p>Callosities are dirty-yellow to brown in color; their extent
depending upon the cause; they are thickest in the
centre and pass gradually into the healthy skin. Sensation
is usually lost, or at least diminished, over these areas.</p>

<p>They may interfere with movement and may have painful
fissures and become infected, giving rise to abscesses,
lymphangitis, gangrene, or erysipelas. Hyperidrosis is
often associated with this condition.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The permanent cure of callosities depends
exclusively upon the removal of their causation. The position
of the foot in the shoe may be faulty because of excessively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
high or low heels, causing callous skin to appear
upon the weight-bearing surface. Occupations requiring
constant standing, and deformities, also enter as causative
factors which must be considered.</p>

<p>The palliative cure rests for its efficacy on the removal
of the horny tissue down to, but not into, the papillary layer.</p>

<h4><b>HELOMA</b></h4>

<h5><b>(Corn or Clavus)</b></h5>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A heavy thickening of the cuticle, usually
caused by pressure, and producing pain by its own pressure
on the tissues beneath.</p>

<p>Though the term heloma is rarely used outside of text
books, there are very few who have not had an unpleasant
acquaintance with this cutaneous affection, under the name
of &#8220;corns.&#8221; Heloma is undoubtedly the most frequent of
all skin diseases.</p>

<p><b>Cause.</b> The exciting cause of helomata is intermittent
pressure combined with friction; while among the predisposing
causes it is only necessary to mention the slavish
adherence to fashion which lends all of us to wear stiff
leather shoes, the contour of which bears little or no relation
to the natural shape of the anterior portion of the foot.
The pressure of the ill-fitting boot upon the toes, or, more
strictly speaking, the pressure of the toes against the unyielding
leather, in walking, soon occasions hypertrophy of
the horny layer at the point of irritation, and in time a
dense, conical, pea-sized or larger mass is formed. The
apex of the cone presses downward on the sensitive papillae
and causes the painful sensation which suggests a visit to
the chiropodist.</p>

<p>Helomata are named according to characteristics which
mark them. When the growth is indurated it is called
heloma durum; when soft, heloma molle; when of the millet
seed variety, heloma miliare; when blood vessels are numerous,
heloma vasculare. Each of these varieties requires
a different method of treatment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Helomata are most frequently found on the outer surface
of the little toes, but may occur upon the sole of the foot
and even upon the palm, or plantar surface of the foot.
Between the toes they often form from pressure of the opposing
digits, caused by narrow shoes, and in this location
they are softer and usually present a whitish, macerated
surface.</p>

<p><b>The Prophylatic Treatment</b> consists in wearing a broad-toed,
though not necessarily a square-toed shoe.</p>

<p>If shoes were made fan-shaped, like the imprint of a
bare-foot in the sand, instead of having the greatest width
across the ball of the foot, they might look strange at first,
but they would be comfortable for all time. Those then
who care more for comfort than for style, as most of us
falsely profess to do, would have both cornless and comely
feet.</p>

<p><b>The Palliative Treatment</b> of helomata consists of first
softening the dense, hard, horny tissue, when it will exfoliate
spontaneously, or be readily scraped away. This
projecting callous portion of the heloma may be removed by
cutting or scraping till, as nearly as may be, the surface is
level with the plane of the adjacent skin.</p>

<p>In the soft variety found between the toes, or in the
vascular ones, located in the arch on the inner border of
the foot, where the skin is thin, no thick covering will be
encountered.</p>

<p>A line or groove will be observed marking the circumference
of any variety of heloma, and it is in this line that
the operative attack must be made.</p>

<p>Helomata of the miliary variety, usually appear on the
sole of the foot and are, as a rule, as numerous as they are
small. The preferable treatment is to use a sharp, pointed
knife in removing each one of the &#8220;seeds&#8221; separately.</p>

<p>A well pointed, narrow blade introduced here will find a
plane of cleavage between the growth and the surrounding
tissue, through which it is possible to dissect quite deeply
without encountering blood. When the dissection reaches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the papillary layer in the skin, as evidenced by the red color,
further operative steps should cease.</p>

<p>In the treatment of soft and vascular growths it may
frequently be preferable to employ disintegrating solutions
from the beginning.</p>

<p>Repetition of the treatment, as described in verruca,
every second or third day, will result in the gradual disintegration
of the growth to its extreme depth, and prove
more satisfactory than the radical operation.</p>

<p>Healing is rapid and with the use of properly shaped,
and roomy foot-gear, recurrence should not take place.</p>

<p>It is evident from the nature of helomata, that any
&#8220;cure,&#8221; rubbed or painted upon the affected surface, can
only cause the softening of a certain thickness of skin, and
that no hope for cure is justified unless the careful and complete
removal of the growth is accomplished and followed
by the use of roomy foot-gear.</p>

<p><b>Radical Cure.</b> The total excision of corns, while disabling
the patient more or less for a few days, is in many
instances justifiable. There is little probability of recurrence
if proper foot-gear is worn, and the results are especially
good if the skin graft operation as devised by Dr.
Robert T. Morris is employed, which is described in the
next paragraph.</p>

<p>After the excision of the growth, a small piece of skin
is removed from the leg and sewn to the denuded area.
This prevents a tough cicatrix forming and assures a normal
skin covering to the area previously occupied by the
corn.</p>

<p>The Text Book of Practical Chiropody, now in course
of preparation, will contain lengthy and explicit articles on
the subjects of verruca and heloma. The purpose here has
been largely to present the subject from a broad surgical
viewpoint. The strictly chiropodial features will be thoroughly
outline in the Text Book of Practical Chiropody
after a manner never before attempted and will include all
details of the chisel methods, the dissecting methods and
the shaving operations.</p>

<h3><b>DISEASES OF THE NAILS</b></h3>

<h4><b>INGROWN NAIL</b></h4>

<p>Although chronic inflammatory affections of the neighboring
skin often produce changes in the form, color and
thickness of the nails, these so rarely call for surgical interference
that only those conditions leading up to the development
of ingrown nail will receive consideration in the
following.</p>

<p>Ingrown nail may be due to either a lateral hypertrophy
of the nail itself cutting into the soft parts, or to the primary
hypertrophy of the soft parts themselves, thus producing
the same picture. An accurate determination of which
condition represents the original etiologic element is important
in deciding upon a course of treatment directed to
the radical cure of ingrown nail.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;radical cure&#8221; does not necessarily indicate
the performance of the so-called radical operation, but may
result from proper treatment of a down-curved nail edge,
or of a diseased nail fold, together with such prophylaxis
in foot-gear as is indicated. With sufficient room in the
shoe and the removal of offending granulations or cutting
nail edge, a radical cure can frequently be effected.</p>

<p>Any inflammatory condition, either of the nail or its
matrix, or the tissues contiguous to the nail, may result in
the train of symptoms which are indicative of ingrown nail.
When, however, any of these conditions has existed sufficiently
long to cause ingrown nail to be present, it ceases
to be of the first importance; it then becomes necessary to
treat the buried nail edge, or the overgrown soft tissues
themselves.</p>

<p><b>The Choice of Method</b> between radical and palliative
operations will depend entirely upon the degree of infection
present, and the facility with which it can be reached.
Thus, in the event of the entire toe being red and swollen
and much purulent discharge being present, there will in
all probability also exist much inflammatory tissue and a
deep burying of the nail edge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>With a tolerant patient it might be possible to scrape
away with a sharp spoon the granulation tissue, and remove
the offending nail edge; the gradual improvement sought
in ordinary cases cannot be thought of in these cases. It
is urgent to relieve the pain and throbbing and to circumvent
the dangers of a spreading infection. The sensations
of a cutting nail edge have been lost in the more severe
development. Should the patient be tolerant of pain, exposure,
disinfection and drainage of the infected area is
possible, but in most instances the contrary will obtain, and
the radical operation with local anesthesia will be indicated.</p>

<p>The possibility of doing an efficient operation will ordinarily
determine the method to be employed.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are a large number of cases
in which palliative treatment is not only effective but emphatically
the method of choice. One might see a degree of
burying of nail edge quite as extensive as in the foregoing,
with however, only a slight degree of infection. The nail
fold may be much hypertrophied and granulation tissue
may be abundant. The tenderness and inflammatory condition,
however, is not so great as to interfere with the
ordinary procedure. There is no danger of a rapidly ascending
infection, the nail groove showing no inordinate
amount of discharge. It is in these cases that a permanent
cure frequently results from the mere removal of the irritating
nail edge followed by the disinfection of the nail
groove.</p>

<p>It is held by many that all cases of ingrown nail, except
those due to a true hypertrophy of the nail, would remain
permanently cured were it not for short or badly shaped
shoes.</p>

<p><b>The Palliative Treatment of Ingrown Nail</b> must necessarily
depend upon its original cause. Should it be due to
the wearing of improper foot-gear, nothing primarily pathologic
in the tissues themselves being present, treatment will
be effective only when correct shoes are worn thereafter.</p>

<p>Eczematous skin surrounding a nail or infection of a
nail groove or matrix, should be treated as such before sufficient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hypertrophy takes place to bury the nail edge. The
disinfection and drainage of the groove can usually be accomplished
with iodin on a thin wire or wooden applicator
inserted to the extreme depth of the groove, followed by
the insertion of a narrow strip of gauze. Frequent changes
of dressings and extreme cleanliness will cause the early
subsidence of these infections. It, however, is to be deplored
that in the early stages these cases so rarely obtain
treatment.</p>

<p>Elevation of the nail edge is often practiced quite successfully,
but in general, this method of treatment is not
applicable to the acute stages of the disease on account of
the concomitant pain. Either the nail is too thick to be
elevated by the insertion of cotton under its free edge, or
the soft tissues are too sensitive to admit of the pressure.</p>

<p>The real skill of the chiropodist is called into practice
in the treatment of ingrown nail by palliative methods, and
he may safely be judged by his results in this class of cases.</p>

<p>It requires discrimination whether to attack the exuberant
granulation tissue or the cutting nail edge, and in
many instances it will be found that both are necessary.</p>

<p>Much skill is required in removing that part of the nail
which is buried without causing pain or bleeding; this is
the first necessity for relieving pain and can only be accomplished
by a technic acquired through practice, and often
redounding more to the credit of the operator than the successful
performance of a major operation. A sharp instrument,
usually a chisel, is placed against the free edge of the
nail so as to cut only through the nail itself and not into
the nail bed, with the purpose in mind of removing a wedge-shaped
piece of nail of just the size necessary to relieve irritation,
and permit of proper drainage and dressing.</p>

<p>Exuberant granulations are best treated either with
nitrate of silver applications (50 per cent.) or with tight
packing, or both. Disinfection and wick drainage of the
entire tract is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p><b>The Radical Treatment of Ingrown Toe Nail.</b> The operations,
as in the palliative treatment, naturally fall into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
two classes depending on (1) whether the nail originally
was at fault, or (2) whether the soft tissues, by inflammatory
processes, have hypertrophied and overgrown.</p>

<p>Operations depending on such diseases or malformations
of the nail, causing it to grow down into the tissues,
should be directed to the removal of the nail, or the offending
part of it with its matrix. (See &#8220;<i>Hypertrophy</i>&#8221;).</p>

<p>In conditions manifestly due to disease and hypertrophy
of the soft tissues, palliative treatment frequently fails, and
it becomes necessary to curet the granulating nail fold or
to erode it with chemicals.</p>

<p>The best and easiest operation to effect a permanent
cure, where this condition obtains, is known as Weber&#8217;s operation.
This operation consists of the excision of an elliptical
section of tissue just alongside of the offending nail
border, without interfering with the diseased tissues themselves,
and suturing the cut edges together in the long direction
of the wound. The incisions are made to extend a
little further back than the nail and as far forward as possible.
They are about a quarter of an inch apart at the
centre and meet at these two points. The depth of the section
of tissue removed, if sufficiently great, leaves a diamond
shaped cavity. When the edges of the wound are
brought together the overgrown edge is pulled away from
the nail and the further cicatrization of the wound contracting
the soft tissues, assures an excellent result.</p>

<h3><b>HYPERTROPHY</b></h3>

<p><b>Hypertrophy</b> can result only from hyperplasia of the
papillae of the matrix, the thickening of the nail occurring
at the base, front, lateral edges, or over its whole extent,
according to the parts diseased. The nail may be evenly
thickened or variously curved or twisted, while its structure
becomes brittle, opaque and discolored.</p>

<p>Removal of the most projecting portions of the nail will
reveal the papillae elevated far above the normal level of
the matrix.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The change is slow and progressive, and when pronounced
is usually permanent. The causes are not well understood;
pressure, however, seems to be an exciting cause,
this being more causative in the nails of the toes, especially
those of the great and the little toe.</p>

<p>The old, whose epithelial structures tend to overgrowth,
are more liable to hypertrophy of the nails than the young.</p>

<p>When attacking the fingers, beyond the blunting of the
tactile sensibility and the deformity, no special trouble
arises, unless painful cracks form from the splitting of the
brittle nails. When affecting the nails of the feet, however,
it is difficult for the patient to wear shoes, the pressure leading
to inflammation of the adjacent soft parts and eventually
causing typical ingrown nail.</p>

<p>Back pressure upon the matrix from a short shoe upon
a thick unresisting nail, is frequently the cause of onychia.</p>

<p><b>Palliative Treatment of Hypertrophy.</b> When the deformity
seriously interferes with the wearing of shoes, or
shows a tendency to cut into the lateral fold, it becomes necessary
to establish normal dimensions either with the knife
or drill.</p>

<p>The total removal of the nail; including the matrix, is
the only permanent cure. Excision of the cutting edge of
the nail, as in radical operation of ingrown nail, eliminates
only that element of discomfort.</p>

<p>The thinning of the nail, by scraping or with the drill,
can also be accomplished with sodium sulphide. A sufficient
quantity of the sulphide is added to starch paste to make it
swell; this, when applied (use a wooden applicator) to the
thickened nail, will cause the nail to disintegrate. By touching
the surface with the applicator, one can determine the
depth of nail destroyed before washing off the excess
sulphide.</p>

<p><b>Radical Treatment of Hypertrophy.</b> When the thick
nail has cut into the lateral fold and actual ulceration has
occurred, it becomes necessary to remove the down-curved
edge.</p>

<p>Under local anesthesia, an incision is made through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
nail, a little to the side of the inflamed area, and is carried
well back through the matrix. A curved incision, outside
of the infected fold, meets the first incision in front and
back of the nail. All the tissue between is removed in one
piece, including the offending portion of nail with its matrix
and the nail fold with all granulation tissue.</p>

<p>This wound may be brought together by catgut sutures,
or may be allowed to heal by granulation.</p>

<p>This operation suffices to prevent further trouble at the
nail edge, but does not prevent the discomforts due to a
long, distorted, horny nail. Total removal of the nail
with its matrix is the only radical cure. (See &#8220;<i>Local
Anesthesia&#8221;</i>).</p>

<p><b>Inflammation of the Matrix (Onychia).</b>
As a result oftraumatism in unhealthy individuals, inflammation and suppuration
sometimes occur at the root of a nail and in the
contiguous portion of matrix (&#8220;run-around&#8221;), and often
stubbornly continue unless the loosened, sharp edge of the
buried nail be carefully trimmed away from time to time,
and a little iodoform gauze be employed to press back the
inflamed tissues.</p>

<p>From lateral hypertrophy of a toe-nail the sharp lateral
edge becomes imbedded in the lateral fold, or from improper
lateral compression of the toes, the same portion of soft
tissues is forced up against the margin of the nail. In
either case, inflammation, suppuration, and ulceration ensue,
resulting in the formation of red, exuberant, excessively
painful granulations, constituting the condition
called <i>ingrowing toe-nail</i>, though more correctly it should
be termed &#8220;up-growing pulp.&#8221; Sometimes both edges, or
even the whole matrix, become involved, producing pain on
any movement of the member.</p>

<p>When inflammation and ulceration of the whole matrix
occur, especially where a finger is involved, the condition is
termed <i>onychia maligna</i>, which attacks only those in depressed
health.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The palliative treatment suggested for ingrown
nail is indicated for all inflammations of the matrix,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as far as the disinfection or removal of the portion of nail
producing irritation is concerned, but in onychia maligna
the whole nail usually requires removal under local anesthesia,
with destruction of the matrix by caustics, or by
curetment</p>

<h2>Chapter XV</h2>

<h3><b>TUMORS AND CYSTS</b></h3>

<h4><b>TUMORS</b></h4>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A tumor is a circumscribed mass of tissue
made up of cells of the same kind as the tissue from which
it grows.</p>

<p>There are two distinct types of tissue in the body:
epithelial and connective, and therefore two types of tumors:
the <i>epithelial tissue tumors</i> and the <i>connective tissue
tumors</i>.</p>

<p>Tumors may also be classified as <i>typical</i>, and <i>atypical</i>.
A typical tumor is one in which the cells are identical to
those in the tissue from which it springs, and also has the
same arrangement of cells. They may be of epithelial or
connective tissue origin. The tissue is identical in all respects
and the growth is benign. An atypical tumor is one
of epithelial or connective tissue origin in which, though
the cells are the same as those in the tissue from which it
grows, their arrangement is quite different. They are malignant.</p>

<p>The most important classification of tumors is that into
<i>benign</i> and <i>malignant</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>benign tumor</i> is one in which there is no tendency to
rapid growth; the symptoms are purely local, and the general
health is not affected, except indirectly.</p>

<p>On the other hand a <i>malignant tumor</i> is one which
takes on a rapid growth with a tendency to infiltrate or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
adhere to surrounding tissues; recurs when removed, and is
accompanied by great pain and a rapid loss of weight and
strength. These are commonly known as cancerous.</p>

<p>Malignant growths are of two types, carcinomatous and
sarcomatous, dependent upon the tissue from which they
emanate.</p>

<p>The <i>carcinomata</i> spring from the epithelial type of tissue
while the <i>sarcomata</i> emanate from the connective tissue
type.</p>

<p><b>Origin.</b> Tumors originate from many causes. Some
are congenital and others grow in later life from an inherited
tendency.</p>

<p>Any continued irritation which acts mechanically or
chemically so as to maintain a constant, though slight, degree
of undue vascularity of a part, such as the hot, rough
stem of a clay pipe or a jagged tooth, favors the development
of a malignant growth. Certain benign growths, such
as warts or moles, are especially prone to malignant change.
Age and sex also predispose to tumor formation.</p>

<p>Thus carcinoma is a rarity under thirty years of age;
the mammary gland of the female is more liable to carcinoma
than the male; while on the other hand the esophagus,
lip and tongue of the male are more liable to attack.</p>

<p>The possibility of certain malignant growths being of
germ origin is thought to be evident (though not yet proven)
from many facts. The fact that where there are malignant
growths present, lymphatic glands, quite distant from the
original growth, become secondarily infected, through the
lymphatic vessels, seems to carry out this view.</p>

<p>Particles of a carcinoma (metastasis) floating in the
blood stream, finding lodgment elsewhere also establish new
growths (metastatic).</p>

<p>Tumors are named according to the tissues from which
they arise, thus:</p>

</div></div>

<h4><b>CYSTS</b></h4>

<p><b>Definition.</b> Cysts are hollow tumors filled with fluid or
semi-solid contents. They are classified according to their
mode of development:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Cysts formed in already existing spaces such
as sebaceous cysts in the sebaceous glands
of the skin; mucous cysts in mucous glands,
and distension cysts in ducts of large glands
like the salivary, lacteal, hepatic, etc.</p>

<p>2. Cysts of new formation into the tissue spaces
from the effusion of blood or plasma.</p>

<p>3. Congenital cysts known as dermoids.</p>

<p>4. Cysts of parasitic origin.</p>

<p>The only cyst with which the chiropodist ordinarily
comes in contact is of the sebaceous variety.</p></div>

<p><b>Sebaceous Cyst.</b> A sebaceous cyst is a tumor resulting
from retained sebum (secretion of the sebaceous glands).</p>

<p>They sometimes, though rarely, are found on the soles
of the feet. They range in size from a millet seed to the
size of an egg or larger; they may be globular or flattened.
They may be single or multiple; the skin over them is normal
in color and smooth, or white if distended, red if inflamed.
They grow very slowly and ordinarily persist indefinitely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
but calcareous changes are common. Not infrequently
they break down and ulcerate. The wall is made up
of connective tissue lined with epithelium and the secretion
if chemically altered, becomes fluid, semi-fluid, cheesy or
purulent.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Spontaneous cure often occurs when a
cyst becomes inflamed and suppurates. The pus is evacuated
either spontaneously or by incision, following which
the walls of the sac adhere and its cavity is obliterated.</p>

<p>Treatment directed toward the obliteration of the sac is
the only procedure which gives promise of permanent cure;
mere puncture and evacuation will effect only temporary
relief, the sac soon filling again.</p>

<p>Incision followed by dissection and removal of the sac,
either intact or punctured, is radical and efficient.</p>

<p>Puncture and evacuation, followed by swabbing out
with pure phenol or strong iodin, may set up an inflammatory
reaction within the sac, which acts similarly to the suppurative
process, causing adhesion of the walls, thus preventing
a recurrence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><b>FRACTURES, DISLOCATIONS AND
SPRAINS</b></h3>

<h4><b>FRACTURES</b></h4>

<p>A fracture may be defined as a broken bone. Fractures
are classified as follows:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. As to their degree.</div>
<div class="line">2. As to the direction of the line of fracture.</div>
<div class="line">3. As to their location.</div>
<div class="line">4. As to the etiology.</div>
<div class="line">5. As to their relation to the overlying skin.</div>
<div class="line">6. As to the number of fragments.</div>
<div class="line">7. As to whether they are complicated or not.</div>
</div></div>

<p><b>Degree of Fracture.</b> A fracture which only involves a
portion of the thickness of the bones, so that its continuity
has not been entirely lost or a fragment has not been completely
detached, is called an <i>incomplete fracture</i>. A fracture
which involves the entire thickness of the bone, so that
it is divided into two or more distinct fragments, is called
a <i>complete fracture</i>.</p>

<h4><b>INCOMPLETE FRACTURES</b></h4>

<p>Among the varieties of incomplete fracture are: greenstick;
fissured; depressed.</p>

<p><b>Greenstick Fractures</b> (really a bending rather than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
break of the bone) are mostly seen under the age of fifteen,
and the bones of the leg are rarely affected.</p>

<p><b>Fissured Fractures</b> are those in which there is a split or
crack in the bones; they are very rare in the bones of the
lower extremity.</p>

<p><b>Depressed Fractures</b> are fractures in which one or more
segments of broken bone are depressed; they are most common
in fractures of the skull.</p>

<h4><b>COMPLETE FRACTURES</b></h4>

<p><b>Complete Fractures</b> are divided according to the line
and the seat of the breech of bone continuity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions of the Lines of Fractures</span></p>

<p><b>Transverse</b>, when the line of fracture does not deviate
more than ten to fifteen degrees from that of the transverse
axis. This variety is rare in the shaft of the long bones.
It is usually found at the lower end of the radius or of the
femur, and in the short bones.</p>

<p><b>Longitudinal</b>, when the break is parallel to the long
diameter of the bone; very few cases of this variety are
seen.</p>

<p><b>Oblique</b>, when the direction of the line of fracture may
form any angle with the transverse axis of the bone up to a
right angle. When it approaches the latter, it belongs to
the group of longitudinal fractures. In the oblique variety,
the line of fracture may be single or multiple. This and
the spiral form are most frequent in the shafts of the long
bones.</p>

<p><b>Spiral</b>, when the break line is spiral. This variety of
fracture was formerly considered to be very rare. The
more systematic use of the X-ray as part of the routine of
diagnosis has shown that spiral fractures are quite frequent
in the shafts of the tibia and fibula. They are usually the
result of a rotating or twisting force.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Classification of Fractures</span></h4>

<p><b>Comminuted</b>, when there is extensive splintering of the
bone adjoining the fracture or one of the fragments.</p>

<p><b>Impacted</b>, when the fragments are driven into each
other. This variety usually occurs in the neck of the femur.</p>

<p><b>Compression, or Crushing Fractures</b>, when the broken
bones are compressed or crushed; this variety usually occurs
in the tarsal bones. The spongy portion and cortical
layer are both crushed. In some cases there is a perfect
pulpification of these bones. This condition occurs after
falls from a height upon the sole of the foot.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Location of Fracture</span></h4>

<p><b>In the Diaphysis of a Bone.</b> Breaks in the diaphysis of
a bone are spoken of as fractures of the <i>shaft</i>, and to be
still more exact, it is stated whether of the upper, middle,
or lower third.</p>

<p><b>At the Ends of Bones.</b> Fractures occurring at the ends
of bones receive the name of the part which the line of
fracture transverses; for example, fractures of the <i>neck</i> of
a bone, of a <i>tuberosity</i>, of a <i>process</i>, of a <i>condyle</i>, etc.</p>

<p>There are two forms of fracture that require special
mention in connection with their location. These are <i>epiphyseal
separations</i> and <i>articular fractures</i>.</p>

<p><b>Epiphyseal Separations.</b> The union of the epiphysis to
the diaphysis commences during puberty, hence these fractures
are less common in childhood than after the ages of
eleven or twelve. As a rule, they can only occur before the
twentieth year. The periosteum is more resisting and
tougher during the early years of life than later on.</p>

<p><b>Articular Fracture</b> (<i>joint fractures</i>). Like epiphyseal
separations, recognition and proper treatment of these
fractures have assumed great importance.</p>

<p>Articular fractures may be divided into three classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Intra-articular.</i> In these the line of fracture
lies entirely within the joint. Such fractures
are most frequently found in the elbow and
knee joint.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Para articular.</i> In these the line of fracture extends
close to the joint but not into it. An
example of this class is the <i>supracondyloid</i>
fracture of the humerus.</p>

<p>3. <i>Articular fractures proper.</i> The majority of
joint fractures belong to this class. The line
of fracture either extends into the joint from
without or it extends from the joint outward.
As example, the ankle joint; the majority
of the typical supramalleolar, malleolar, and
spiral fractures of the tibia and fibula.</p></div>

<p><b>Etiology.</b> Fractures may be divided into two groups:
the <i>traumatic</i> and the <i>pathologic</i> or <i>spontaneous</i>. In the
traumatic, the fracture is the result of violence acting upon
a bone which is either normal or shows slight changes due
to the physiologic causes mentioned. A pathologic or spontaneous
fracture is one which occurs in a bone, the strength
of which has been diminished by some preceding abnormal
or pathologic changes. In this variety the degree of force
which produced the fracture would not be sufficient to cause
a fracture in a healthy bone.</p>

<p>The causes of traumatic fractures may be either predisposing
or exciting.</p>

<p><b>Predisposing Causes.</b> The bones of the human body
attain their greatest strength toward middle age. From infancy
up to that time the bones are very elastic and yielding.
Toward old age an interstitial atrophy occurs. It
causes a thinning of the cortex of the shafts and of the
trabeculae of the spongy portions of the long and short
bones. It is an actual diminution of the bone substance and
a corresponding increase of the fat. This is especially seen
in the neck of the femur. When it occurs in old age, it
acts as a predisposing cause, but when it occurs prematurely
or reaches an extreme degree, it must be considered as
pathologic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Existing or Determining Causes of Fractures</span></h4>

<p><b>Fractures by External Violence</b> are divided both clinically
and from a mechanic standpoint into two classes:
<i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i>. In fractures by direct violence the bone
breaks immediately under the point where the force has
been applied. In this class of fractures there is more damage
to the soft tissues and this damage is generally more
serious than in indirect fractures. Direct fractures are
more likely to occur in exposed bones like the clavicle, os
calcis, etc.</p>

<p>An example of fracture by direct violence is found in
fractures of the tarsal bones after a fall upon the feet from
a height.</p>

<p>Under the head of fractures by indirect violence belong
(a) those which occur as the result of a rotary or twisting
force (spiral fracture of the tibia or fibula, for example);
(b) those which are produced by compression; (for example,
a fall upon the feet may cause an impacted fracture
of the upper end of the tibia); (c) those which are the
result of a tearing force.</p>

<p>Fractures resulting from a tearing force occur when
a joint is suddenly moved beyond its normal range of excursion.
The firmly attached ligaments being a fixed point,
the ends or some process of the bones composing the joint
are torn off from the remainder of the bone. Examples of
this are fractures of the internal or external malleoli, following
forcible eversion or inversion of the foot.</p>

<p>Fractures are also caused by muscular action and by
gunshot injuries.</p>

<p><b>Pathologic</b> (spontaneous fractures):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Fractures resulting from bone fragility of local
origin as for example, tumors, osteomyelitis,
aneurisms.</p>

<p>2. Fractures resulting from bone fragility due to
some general disease, as for example, tabes
dorsalis, paresis, rachitis, osteomalacia, and
exhausting chronic diseases.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Classification and Relation of Fractures to the
Overlying Skin</span></h4>

<p>Fractures are divided into <i>compound</i>, or <i>open</i> and
<i>simple</i>, or <i>subcutaneous</i>, according to whether a communication
does or does not exist between the seat of fracture
and a wound of the skin.</p>

<p>A compound fracture is one in which the cutaneous
wound communicates with the seat of the fracture.</p>

<p>A simple fracture is one in which a wound of the skin
is absent, or, if present, no communication exists between
it and the seat of the fracture.</p>

<p>The majority of compound fractures are the result of
direct violence, and the injuries of the soft parts, are, as a
rule, far more extensive and serious than in a simple fracture.
A fracture which is simple at first, may become compound
as a result of necrosis of the skin lying over it; or as
a consequence of the original injury; or of pressure upon
it by a displaced fragment; or by penetration of the skin,
in efforts to use the limb.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Further Classification of Fractures</span></h4>

<p><b>Fracture.</b> In the ordinary use of the term &#8220;fracture&#8221;
is understood to indicate a <i>complete</i> or <i>incomplete</i> separation
of the bone into two or more fragments, the lines of
which are continuous with each other.</p>

<p><b>Multiple Fracture.</b> The term <i>multiple fracture</i> is applied
to the simultaneous fracture of two or more non-adjacent
bones, and also to those cases in which two or more
fractures of the same bone exist, and the lines are not continuous
with each other. Such multiple fractures are usually
the result of direct violence.</p>

<p><b>Complicated Fracture.</b> When a fracture is accompanied
by injuries of the viscera, nerves, etc., the term <i>complicated
fracture</i> is applied. Such a fracture may be simple
or compound. The term complicated, as ordinarily employed,
is limited to those fractures which are accompanied
by local, rather than by general complications.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms of a Recent Fracture.</b> In the examination of
a patient who has sustained a recent fracture, procedure
should be as follows: the history of the patient and of the
accident should be taken; an examination should be made
for objective signs, like deformity, abnormal mobility,
crepitus, and ecchymosis; subjective symptoms, such as pain
and loss of function of the limb should be ascertained; an
X-ray picture should be taken and every possible precaution
observed to exclude distortion or exaggeration.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Fractures.</b> <i>First Aid.</i> The treatment of
fracture may be said to begin from the moment of its occurrence.
Much can be done for the comfort of the patient
and correct union of the fracture by intelligent treatment
during the first hours.</p>

<p>The proper temporary fixation of the limb, the mode of
transportation, and the removal of the clothing, all require
special mention.</p>

<p>The use of first aid dressings, those which can be used
until more permanent and suitable ones can be applied,
varies, of course, with the individual bone affected. In fractures
of the tibia, fibula and foot, as well as in those of the
lower half of the femur, the use of the blanket splint will
be found of great aid. Instead of a blanket, a long pillow
or soft cushion can be employed in the same manner.</p>

<p>The &#8220;blanket splint&#8221; can be readily made by folding a
blanket in such a manner that it extends from the middle of
the injured thigh to below the foot. Two pieces of narrow,
strong board, or better still, two broomsticks are rolled up
in the blanket, one at either end. The rolled-up blanket is
now turned in so that the board supports with their enveloping
turns of blanket, lie upon the posterior surface. Thus,
a trough is formed in which the limb is placed and firmly
secured by loops of bandage, one below the foot, the second
just above the ankle, the third below the knee, and the
fourth near the upper end of the blanket.</p>

<p>In fractures of the leg, after the application of the
emergency splint, the patient should be transported in a
recumbent position, the support being as firm as possible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a wide board, shutter or a wooden rail being preferable.
If such supports are not at hand, and the patient is to be
moved without their use, the persons transporting the invalid
should be distributed in the following manner: one
supporting the head and shoulders, a second the pelvis, and
the third the two limbs.</p>

<p><b>Reduction.</b> The reduction of a fracture is the effort
made by the surgeon to overcome any tendency to displacement,
and thus to place the fragments in such close apposition
that an accurate and firm union is possible. The best
time in general for the reduction of a fracture is as soon
as possible after the accident, if the patient&#8217;s general condition
will permit. If there is marked displacement of
fragments, so that there is danger of necrosis of the overlying
skin or of damage to the adjacent vessels or nerves,
an early reduction is imperative.</p>

<p>In all cases in which reduction is very painful or difficult,
whether performed shortly after the accident or at
a later period, it is best to administer an anesthetic to overcome
muscular contraction and to decrease the amount of
pain. After reduction of a fracture, retentive apparatus is
indicated in order to maintain apposition. In the use of
dressings there will be two kinds, those which are temporary
and those which are permanent. The former are employed
where the swelling of the limb is such that some dressing
can be employed which will not cause pressure.</p>

<p>Certain general principles should be followed in the
use of splints; for instance, a splint, after being applied,
should not interfere with the circulation, allowance always
being made for the swelling of the limb, which almost invariably
occurs during the first week. The splint, if flat,
should be wide enough to obviate the possibility of pressure
against the point of fracture; also, it should project a
little beyond the limb.</p>

<p>In general, it is best to immobilize the adjacent joints,
above and below the seat of fracture, but no dressing should
be permitted to remain so long as to produce stiffness of
the joints and muscular atrophy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The skin, even in simple fractures, must be cleansed
with green soap, water and alcohol. If blebs or an area of
threatening necrosis of the skin exist, they should be freely
dusted with powdered boric acid and a few layers of aseptic
gauze applied.</p>

<p>The form of retentive apparatus to be employed will
vary, of course, with the individual bone requiring treatment.</p>

<p>The most important articles of a fracture equipment
are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Plaster of Paris bandages for making molded
splints and circular casts.</p>

<p>2. A stock of basswood, three-sixteenths of an
inch thick, for making wooden splints.</p>

<p>3. An assortment of metal splints or materials for
making them.</p>

<p>4. Muslin for bandages and slings.</p>

<p>5. Five yard rolls of ordinary and zinc oxide adhesive
plaster, three inches wide.</p>

<p>6. Cotton batting and sheet wadding for padding
splints.</p>

<p>7. Strips of tin or thin cypress for strengthening
plaster casts.</p></div>

<p>The selection of a dressing for the immobilization of a
fracture depends upon, <i>first</i>, the particular bone involved
and whether apposition can be maintained with or without
extension; <i>second</i>, whether great swelling be present or not;
<i>third</i>, whether the fracture be simple or compound; and <i>last</i>,
whether ambulatory treatment be preferable to that in the
recumbent position. This latter applies, of course, only to
fractures of the lower extremity.</p>

<p><b>Operative Treatment of Simple Fractures.</b> Operative
treatment of a recent simple fracture is indicated in general,
when reduction cannot be completely made; when correct
apposition cannot be maintained; when there is interposition
of bone or soft parts; when the fracture is a spiral
one with considerable displacement of the fragments; when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
fragments are rotated upon each other, and when there are
multiple fractures.</p>

<p>The most favorable time to operate in recent simple
fractures is at the end of the first or beginning of the second
week. At this time the process of callus formation is
most active. The blood clots and loose shreds of tissue have
begun to be absorbed, so that the fragments are more easily
accessible.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Fixation of the Fragments.</b> In the majority
of cases the reposition of the fragments alone is not sufficient
to maintain accurate apposition. It is usually necessary
to employ some means of mechanical fixation. In all
the methods employed, the preparation of the parts is the
same as for any aseptic operation. The opportunity for
serious complications resulting from septic infection, is
greater than in any other class of operations. It is for this
reason that extraordinary caution must be exercised. The
incision should be large enough to expose the seat of the
fracture thoroughly.</p>

<p>The materials used to secure fixation are: absorbable
sutures, such as chromicized catgut or kangaroo tendon;
metal suture of silver or bronze aluminum wire; screws,
nails, plates, clamps, etc.</p>

<p><b>Injuries in the Vicinity of the Ankle Joint.</b> In the examination
of a patient who shows evidence of injury in
the vicinity of the ankle joint, such as swelling, deformity,
loss of function, etc., the following conditions must be
thought of, in the order given:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. Fractures of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula (Pott&#8217;s Fracture).</div>
<div class="line">2. Dislocation at or near the ankle.</div>
<div class="line">3. Fractures of the tarsal bones.</div>
<div class="line">4. Rupture of the tendon Achillis.</div>
<div class="line">5. Sprains of the ankle.</div>
</div></div>

<p><b>Fractures of the Lower Ends of the Tibia and Fibula.</b>
Commonly given the name of <i>Pott&#8217;s Fracture</i>. They may
be the result either of forcible abduction or eversion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
foot, or of inversion or adduction. If the sole or main
movement is eversion, the <i>internal</i> malleolus is broken, and
if the force continues to act, it also causes the <i>external</i>
malleolus to be broken. In the second variety, fracture by
inversion, the first effect of the force is to break the fibula
at the external malleolus. If the movement continues, the
internal malleolus or a greater portion of the tibia is broken
off.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> The diagnosis is usually easy to make. The
ankle joint is greatly swollen, the depression, normally present
in front of and behind the malleoli, being obliterated.
The foot is displaced outward, and the internal malleolus
is prominent. This deformity will often persist and become
a cause of disability after healing of the fracture.</p>

<p>There is also backward displacement of the foot. These
displacements may be so marked as, at first glance, to
resemble a true dislocation of the ankle.</p>

<p>Abnormal lateral and anteroposterior mobility may be
ascertained by grasping the sole of the foot with one hand
and moving it inward and outward, or backward and forward,
while the other hand steadies the leg. There is great
tenderness between the tibia and fibula at the front of the
ankle, and over the points of fracture in the malleoli.</p>

<p>If the fibula alone be broken, abnormal mobility and
crepitus may be elicited by pressing its tip inward with the
index finger of the one hand while a finger of the other hand
is placed at the seat of fracture.</p>

<p>In some cases of Pott&#8217;s fracture the foot will move inward
instead of outward. The degree of outward displacement
can be measured by the difference in the distance from
the front of the ankle to the cleft between the first and second
toes, as measured on the sound and injured foot. There
is not always complete loss of function. In fractures of the
external malleolus alone, the patient may walk quite well.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Fractures of the Leg.</b> The treatment of
a simple fracture of one or of both bones of the leg depends
<i>first</i>, upon whether or not swelling is present, and <i>second</i>,
upon the amount of displacement of fragments and our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
ability to keep them in apposition after reduction. If the
case is seen within a few hours after the injury and but
little, if any, swelling be present, the following is a perfectly
safe and justifiable method of treatment:</p>

<p>The limb is wrapped with strips of sheet-wadding from
the toes to the middle of the thigh, and a circular plaster
of Paris cast is applied extending over the same area. Before
the cast is dry, it is cut open along the median line, in
front, to allow for any swelling. The cast is best applied
while the patient is under the influence of an anesthetic,
so as to permit reduction of the fragments by traction upon
the foot. In from ten days to two weeks the cast should
be removed and a fresh one applied. The second cast does
not require to be cut open, and can be left on the limb until
the end of the fourth week. It is then removed and if union
be complete, no further cast need be worn. Massage of the
limb and passive and active motion are now begun.</p>

<p><b>Fractures of the Tarsal Bones.</b> Fractures of these bones
have been found far more frequently than was thought before
the use of the X-ray. Many cases of tarsal fracture
have been treated for sprains of the ankle. It is only when
the recovery is slow or the injury is followed by a traumatic
flat foot that the surgeon begins to suspect that a
more serious condition was present at the time of the
original injury.</p>

<p>The astragalus and os calcis are the tarsal bones that
are usually affected. Fractures of the os calcis, in the majority
of cases, are due to compression. The patient falls
from a height to the ground, on a hard substance. The os
calcis is crushed between the astragalus and the ground.</p>

<p>There are three general types of fracture of the os
calcis:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That in which the fracture has been confined
largely to that portion lying behind a vertical
plane through the middle of the body of
the astragalus. There are three varieties of
this heel fragment type: (<i>a</i>) cases with one
large heel fragment; (<i>b</i>) cases of small heel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fragments (in this variety, also called avulsion
fracture, the sudden contraction of the
calf muscles pulls the fragment off; at times
the tendo Achillis itself is torn off from the
attachment to the os calcis at the same time);
(<i>c</i>) cases showing only fissures in the bone.</p>

<p>2. Comminution of the anterior half of the os
calcis.</p>

<p>3. All the cases of extensive comminution of the
bones; the bone is literally shattered.</p></div>

<p><b>Fractures of the Astragalus.</b> These can be divided into:
(<i>a</i>) those of the neck; (<i>b</i>) those of the body. The former
are the most common fractures of the astragalus. They
may follow sudden dorsal flexion, or forced supination, or
pronation of the foot. They may be due to a fall from a
height or from direct violence. Fractures of the body of
the astragalus are usually the result of a crushing force
which ordinarily have a like effect on the body of the os
calcis, and are often associated with fractures of the latter
bone. The variety of fractures is considerable, varying from
two large fragments, to complete comminution of the bone.</p>

<p>A fact of considerable importance in the interpretation
of skiagraphs of fractures of the astragalus, is a knowledge
of the presence in many normal individuals of a little bone
known as the <i>os trigonum</i>. It may occur detached from the
astragalus or may be attached to it as a process, on its posterior
aspect, and on account of the swelling and pain around
the ankle, a diagnosis can seldom be made without the routine
use of the X-ray in every injury in this region.</p>

<p>The swelling, with obliteration of the depressions normally
present around the ankle, does not differ from that
characteristic of a sprain of the ankle or of a Pott&#8217;s fracture.
If there is extensive comminution of the os calcis or
astragalus, the malleoli may be a little lower than normal.</p>

<p>The X-ray must always remain our most reliable means
of diagnosis at the time of the injury. At a later period the
chief symptoms are a painful flat foot, ankylosis of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
ankle joint, pain and difficulty in pronating and supinating
the foot.</p>

<p>The prognosis of fractures of the tarsal bones is not
favorable, even though the lesion has been recognized at the
time of injury. Even in the most favorable cases there is
some limitation of lateral motion. The outlook is better in
those cases of fracture of the os calcis in which there is a
large heel fragment, than if the fracture is comminuted.
The most frequent sequel is stiffness of the ankle-joint and
traumatic pes valgus. Infection is frequent in compound
fractures.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> This does not differ from that of a Pott&#8217;s
fracture until the greater part of the swelling has disappeared.
The skin of the foot and lower portion of the leg
should be thoroughly cleansed and covered with gauze. This
is necessary on account of the possibility of necrosis of the
skin of the heel, and the danger of infection of the bruised
soft tissues around the heel.</p>

<p>The foot should be placed in a well-padded box or in a
posterior splint of the Volkman type. Ice bags should be
applied over the sides of the heel.</p>

<p>After from eight to ten days, a circular plaster cast can
be applied, extending from the toes to the knee. An anesthetic
should be given during the application of the cast,
the foot being held flexed at right angles and sheet wadding
freely used around the ankle. The cast should be worn for
seven weeks. At the end of this time the patient is gradually
permitted to step upon the injured foot. Passive and
active motion are also now employed.</p>

<p>Fractures of the neck of the astragalus, with rotation
of the posterior fragment, are usually followed by great
limitation of the movements of the ankle joint. This condition
might be greatly improved by an open operation.</p>

<p><b>Fractures of the Metatarsal Bones.</b> These are usually
due to direct violence, as occurs when a heavy weight falls
upon the dorsum of the foot. Another example of direct
violence is a fracture following a crushing injury, as in
being run over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>In indirect violence, such as follows dancing, jumping,
or sudden twists of the foot, the fifth metatarsal bone is the
one most often involved. There is but little tendency to
displacement except when several bones are broken at the
same time, and then it is toward the dorsum of the foot.</p>

<p>The diagnosis in fractures produced by direct violence
is made from the following: presence of severe localized
pain; swelling; and, not infrequently, crepitus and abnormal
mobility. In those fractures due to indirect violence
(second, third and fifth metatarsals), there is pain when the
patient endeavors to put pressure upon the toes or tries
to invert the foot. The usual signs of fracture are absent.
A skiagraph should be made in every case.</p>

<p>Fracture of the metatarsal bones is liable to be followed
by traumatic flat foot, on account of the sinking of the
arch, or painful large calluses forming on the sole of the
foot may interfere with walking.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment in such fractures is by immobilization
in a posterior metal or plaster splint, for four
weeks. If there is continual pain upon walking after the
injury, a steel insole will often give relief. The treatment
of compound fractures of the metatarsal bones does not differ
from that of other bones.</p>

<p><b>Dislocations.</b> A dislocation is a displacement from each
other of the articular ends of the bones which enter into the
formation of a joint. A diagnosis can usually be made from
certain objective and subjective symptoms, taken in conjunction
with an accurate history of the manner in which
the accident occurred.</p>

<p>Examination should be made in a systematic manner
in every case, us follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Inspection.</i> The limb should be first inspected to
note the position, the alterations of contour, or of the axis of
the limb, or the projection or absence of certain bony
prominences. The position is often so characteristic that
a diagnosis can be made by inspection alone.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Palpation.</i> By this one can learn the relation of
the displaced articular ends to each other, unless the swell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>ing
is too great, or the patient is very stout. This method
also enables one to ascertain the absence of normal prominences
or the presence of abnormal ones. The end of the
displaced bone may be felt in an abnormal position.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Measurement.</i> The limb may only appear to be or
is actually shortened. In the latter event the normal measurements
between bony prominences will be altered.</p>

<p>(4) <i>A skiagraph</i> should be made in all doubtful cases
to confirm the diagnosis of dislocation, and also to ascertain
whether there is an accompanying fracture.</p>

<p>When the patient is stout, or when considerable swelling
exists the use of the X-ray is of especial value.</p>

<p>The attitude of the limb is often so characteristic that
simple inspection will enable one to make a diagnosis by
this means alone. In stout persons, a change in the axis of
the limb or a change in position is apt to be overlooked.
The relation of the articular surfaces can be determined by
palpation, unless the swelling is too great. Measurement
of the limb will usually show a shortening, depending upon
the position in which the limb is held. The movements of
a dislocated joint are usually limited. If any movement of
the end of one of the bones is felt, it is always at an abnormal
point. Pain is referred to the dislocated joint and
the patient is unable to use the limb.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> As a rule, a dislocation should be reduced
as soon as the diagnosis is made, and, if necessary, an anesthetic
should be administered.</p>

<p>When reduction has been accomplished, the bone often
goes back with a snap, the contour of the limb is restored,
and the movements of the joint are free again.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to reduce a recent dislocation, the
following obstacles must be considered: (<i>a</i>) interposed
portions of the capsule; (<i>b</i>) interposed muscles or tendons
or sesamoid bones; (<i>c</i>) torn off fragments of bone; (<i>d</i>) a
fracture of the shaft close to its articular end, which would
prevent its being used as a lever for reduction.</p>

<p>The after-treatment of a dislocation is usually quite
simple. A bandage or splint should be applied, which will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
keep the joint immobilized for a period of two weeks, after
which passive motion and massage can be begun for fifteen
minutes twice daily, the splint or bandage then to be reapplied
for another two weeks.</p>

<h4><b>DISLOCATIONS AT THE ANKLE JOINT</b></h4>

<p><b>Backward Dislocations</b> occur more frequently than
those in a forward direction.</p>

<p>The injury usually is the result of a fall backward while
the foot is flexed. This causes an extreme plantar flexion
of the foot. The astragalus, and with it the foot, is displaced
backward. The lateral ligaments are usually extensively
torn. In the majority of cases there is an accompanying
fracture of either one or both malleoli or of the
shaft of the fibula.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> The front portion of the foot is shortened
while the heel is more prominent than normal. The lower
end of the tibia protrudes over the dorsum of the foot and
the sharp edge of its articular surface can be distinctly felt.
The extensor tendons and the tendo Achillis are tense and
prominent. It may be distinguished from a supramalleolar
fracture by the fact that the malleoli in the latter have
moved backward with the foot, while in a dislocation backward
they are prominent at some distance in front of the
heel.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Reduction is usually effected by forced
plantar flexion, the foot being pulled forward and the lower
end of the tibia being pushed backward. These steps are
then followed by dorsal flexion of the foot.</p>

<p>After reduction, the leg should be immobilized for three
weeks in a molded posterior splint. Light passive motion
can be begun during the fourth week. In old unreduced
cases an arthrotomy is indicated.</p>

<p><b>Forward Dislocations.</b> These are much rarer than the
backward form. They are usually due to a forced dorsal
flexion of the foot. This form is less often accompanied by
a fracture of the malleoli than is the case in the backward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
dislocation. The fibula is seldom broken, the usual seat of
the fracture being in the tip of the internal malleolus or in
the articular surface of the tibia.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> The whole foot appears to be lengthened.
The prominence due to the heel has disappeared; the upper
articular surface of the astragalus can be felt, the tibia and
the malleoli being nearer to the heel.</p>

<p>The condition can be differentiated from a fracture of
both bones of the leg above the malleoli by the fact that in
a forward dislocation the malleoli are further back than
normal, while in a supramalleolar fracture they have moved
forward with the foot.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Reduction is readily effected by marked
dorsal flexion of the foot, pressure being made in a forward
direction upon the lower end of the tibia, and the foot
pushed backward. Plantar flexion now completes the reduction.
The after treatment is the same as in the backward
form.</p>

<p><b>Lateral Dislocations.</b> The other forms of dislocations
seen in the ankle are those in a lateral direction, either inward
or outward. The diagnosis is usually easy. The upper
convex surface of the astragalus is directed toward the
external malleolus and can be felt there. The inner border
of the foot is raised; the outer rests upon the bed.</p>

<p>This form of dislocation is very frequently a compound
one, or it is accompanied by fractures of the bones of the
leg or of the astragalus; but it may occur without these
injuries.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The treatment of these lateral dislocations
differs but little from that of fractures of the lower end of
the tibia and fibula. Reduction is effected by adduction or
abduction of the foot. The chief danger is from infection
on account of the extensive injury of the skin and soft parts.
If reduction is impossible, perform an arthrotomy.</p>

<p><b>Subastragaloid Dislocation.</b> Two forms of dislocation
can occur in the joint between the astragalus and the two
tarsal bones (os calcis and scaphoid) with which it articulates.
In the true subastragaloid form, the astragalus continues
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to articulate with the tibia and fibula, but it is displaced
from its articulation with the os calcis and scaphoid.
In the second form of subastragaloid dislocation, the astragalus
is completely separated from its articulation with
the bones of the leg as well as with the calcaneus and scaphoid.
To this form the name total dislocation of the astragalus
is given.</p>

<p><b>True Subastragaloid Dislocations.</b> These dislocations
may occur in four directions, inward, outward, forward, and
backward.</p>

<p><i>Dislocation inward.</i> The most frequent cause is a
forcible adduction of the foot combined with violence acting
in the direction of the long axis of the foot. The diagnosis
can be made from the position of the foot. The foot
is adducted and rotated inward, as in a case of clubfoot.
The sole of the foot is directed inward. The inner edge of
the foot is concave and shortened while the outer edge appears
lengthened. The external malleolus and head of the
astragalus are very prominent on the outer side of the foot.
Below and behind the inner malleolus the scaphoid projects
beneath the skin.</p>

<p><i>Dislocation Outward.</i> This occurs after forced adduction
of the foot. The symptoms are the opposite of those of
the inward variety. The foot is in the position of a flat foot,
its inner edge depressed and outer edge raised. The inner
malleolus is close to the sole of the foot, and in front of it
the head of the astragalus forms a prominence. The injury
is not infrequently compound, so that the astragalus
presents into the wound.</p>

<p><i>Dislocation Backward.</i> The cause is usually a plantar
flexion of the foot. The signs are very pronounced; the
head of the astragalus can be seen and felt lying upon the
upper surface of the scaphoid and cuneiform bones. The
anterior portion of the foot is shortened while the heel is
lengthened and the tendo Achillis is very prominent.</p>

<p><i>Dislocation Forward.</i> This follows forced dorsal flexion
of the foot, the patient falling forward after landing with
his heels upon the ground. The diagnosis can be made because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of the lengthened anterior portion of the foot and the
shortened heel. An important point in the diagnosis of
subastragaloid dislocation is the absence of any prominence
due to the projection of the body of the astragalus, in front,
behind, or to either side of the malleoli, as is seen in the
case of the tibiotarsal dislocations. A second diagnostic
point is the abnormal position of the calcaneus and scaphoid
with relation to the malleoli and astragalus. The swelling
is usually so great that a diagnosis is very difficult without
the use of the X-ray.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Subastragaloid Dislocations.</b> Reduction
can usually be effected in recent cases by manipulation and
traction. In the inward variety the existing adduction is
at first increased. Pressure is now made over the outer
side of the adduction and the inner side of the foot, and the
foot is then strongly abducted. In the outward variety,
the abduction is first increased. Pressure is then made over
the outer side of the foot until reduction is effected. In
the backward variety, the plantar flexion is first increased
and the foot is then strongly flexed in the opposite direction.
In the forward type, forced dorsal flexion will effect
reduction. The foot should be placed upon a posterior
molded splint for three weeks, after which passive motions
are begun. If the reduction is impossible, an arthrotomy
with excision of the astragalus may be necessary.</p>

<p><b>Total Dislocation of the Astragalus.</b> This form of dislocation
is much more frequent than those of the ankle joint
proper, or of the articulation between the astragalus, calcaneus,
and scaphoid. The displacement of the astragalus
may occur in one of six directions: forward; outward and
forward; inward and forward; inward; backward, and by
rotation.</p>

<p>The most frequent variety is the &#8220;outward and forward.&#8221;
In this variety the foot is rotated markedly inward
and the external malleolus is very prominent. The foot is
in a clubfoot position. The dislocated astragalus can be
felt as an irregular angular bone just below the external
malleolus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Treatment</b> is the same as in subastragaloid dislocations.</p>

<p><b>Dislocation of the Metatarsal Bones.</b> This may be
either complete or incomplete at Lisfranc&#8217;s joint. It occurs
most often in an upward direction. The dorsum of the
foot is more convex than normal, while the sole of the foot
is flattened. One can see and feel the displaced ends
(upper) of the metatarsals on the dorsum of the foot. The
foot is shortened and the toes point inward.</p>

<p>Dislocations of the individual metatarsal bones are
much rarer. The middle ones are displaced upward, and
the first and fifth, inward and outward respectively.</p>

<p><b>Dislocation of the Toes.</b> This occurs most often in
the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe after forcible
flexion. The dislocation may be complete or incomplete. In
the former case, the proximal end of the first phalanx and
the dorsum of the foot are prominent, and the head of the
metatarsal bone projects on the sole of the foot. The reduction
of toe dislocations presents no difficulties.</p>

<h3><b>SPRAINS</b></h3>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A sprain is a joint wrench due to a sudden
twist or traction, the ligaments being pulled upon or lacerated
and the surrounding parts being more or less
damaged.</p>

<p><b>Sprains of the Ankle.</b> On account of its flexibility and
constant use in weight-bearing, the ankle is the joint most
frequently sprained.</p>

<p>Sprains are common in a limb with weak muscles; in a
deformed extremity in which the muscles act in unnatural
lines, and in a joint with relaxed ligaments.</p>

<p>A joint, once sprained, is very liable to a repetition of
the damage from slight force.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms manifested in a sprain are
as follows: severe pain in the joint; nausea and sometimes
syncope; impairment, or loss of motion; severe pain upon
motion; early swelling if hemorrhage is severe&#8212;in any case
swelling begins in a few hours; movement of the joint becomes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
difficult or impossible; the tear in the ligament may
be distinctly felt; in a day or two pain and tenderness
become intense and discoloration becomes marked.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> Usually the diagnosis is easy to make, but
in all doubtful cases an X-ray picture should be taken in
order to be certain that a fracture does not exist.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The first indication is to arrest hemorrhage
and to limit inflammation. For the first few hours apply
pressure and an ice-bag. Wrap the joint in absorbent cotton,
wet with iced water; apply a wet gauze bandage, and
put on an ice bag.</p>

<p>In a mild sprain, use lead and opium wash. In a severe
sprain, place the extremity upon a splint and apply to the
joint flannel kept wet with lead-water and laudanum, iced
water, tincture of arnica or alcohol and water. If the pain
is severe, a small dose of morphine should be given.</p>

<p>Judicious bandaging limits the swelling. When the
acute symptoms begin to subside, rub stimulating liniments,
such as chloroform or arnica, upon the joint once or twice
a day and employ firm compression by means of a bandage
of flannel or rubber. Later in the case use hot and cold
douches, massage, passive motion and the bandage.</p>

<p>Another method of treatment of sprains of the ankle is
by strapping with adhesive plaster, but it is advisable only
for slight injuries. In severe cases, in which extensive
laceration of the ligaments is suspected from the marked
extravasation, it is best to immobilize the foot in a plaster-of-Paris
splint for two weeks; later baking in a hot-air
oven (see &#8220;Arterial Hyperemia&#8221;) with massage, and active
and passive motion are advisable.</p>

<p>In simple sprains, the fixation does not produce serious
stiffness, and without fixation the repair of the ligaments
is only partial. In the latter case, the result is weakness
of the ligaments and an instability of the foot which
leads to frequent recurrence. This explains many habitual
sprains. On the other hand, under appropriate treatment,
a sprain should recover without leaving any functional
disturbance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><b>DEFORMITIES</b></h3>

<h4><b>PES PLANUS, OR FLAT FOOT</b></h4>

<p>The terms <i>weak foot</i> and <i>flat foot</i> will be used to designate
the <i>mild</i> and the <i>severe</i> forms of the same condition
which include all the deviations from the normal height of
the arch of the foot.</p>

<p><b>Flat Foot</b> may be congenital or acquired, the former
being a very infrequent deformity, and the latter one of the
most common pathologic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Congenital Flat Foot</b> is a deformity of infrequent occurrence,
and in some cases is associated with defective
formation of the bones of the foot. In this condition the
whole foot is displaced outward in relation to the leg; the
sole is rolled outward, the inner malleolus is prominent and
the foot is abducted on itself, and in severe cases, it cannot
be replaced in its normal position on account of the contracted
tissues.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The foot should be massaged and, by gentle
manipulation, forced into its proper position and held by
a plaster-of-Paris dressing, changed at the proper intervals.
A tenotomy may be required to bring the foot into its proper
position.</p>

<p>When the child begins to walk, a well-fitting arch support
should be worn.</p>

<p><b>Acquired Flat Foot.</b> The common form of acquired
flat foot is the static variety, which is an expression of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
disproportion between the body weight and the sustaining
power of the muscles and ligaments.</p>

<p><b>Common Causes.</b> 1. The use of improper shoes is by
all means the most frequent cause of flat foot, and frequently
makes all of the following causes more pronounced.</p>

<p>2. Weakness and insufficiency of the muscles, resulting
from poor general condition; advancing age; convalescence
from acute illness; from childbirth; and from injuries of
the leg, especially fractures.</p>

<p>3. Prolonged standing, especially on hard wood and
stone floors.</p>

<p>4. Rapid body growth.</p>

<p>5. Rapid increase in body weight.</p>

<p>6. Excessive weight bearing.</p>

<p>7. Shortened condition of the gastrocnemius muscle.</p>

<p>Other causes are rickets; inflammation of the ankle
joint, as in tuberculosis; or, as a result of a badly treated
fracture of the ankle-joint; or, as a result of paralysis of
the muscles of the inner side of the leg.</p>

<p><b>Pathology of Acquired Flat Foot.</b> The pathologic condition
is due to change in the relations of the bones rather
than to any change in the bones themselves. The abnormal
position is an exaggeration of the normal yielding of the
foot under weight bearing. The front of the astragalus
rotates inward, and with it the bones of the leg turn at the
hip-joint.</p>

<p>The deformity is essentially a displacement of the
astragalus on the bones of the tarsus. The scaphoid, cuneiform,
and the base of the first metatarsal move downward
and inward with the head of the astragalus; the outer border
of the foot is made more concave and the inner border
becomes convex in extreme cases. In the severest cases, the
head of the astragalus, and scaphoid may be displaced below
the plane of the other bones. The ligaments are respectively
shortened and stretched in the severest cases and
there is a loss of motion in certain of the tarsal articulations,
due to faulty apposition of joint surfaces, and to
constant strain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The feet burn and tire easily and feel stiff
and lame. They may swell, and the size of the shoe worn
must be then increased. Later, a painful period generally
begins in which walking is avoided and a dragging pain in
the arch and behind the inner malleolus is noticed. This
is increased by walking and standing and tender points may
be found under the scaphoid and on the upper surface of
the heel. The foot feels strained and irritated and is a
constant source of discomfort. The inner malleolus is generally
more prominent and the foot is displaced outward
in relation to the leg. The height of the arch is somewhat
diminished; it may be much lowered, or it may be flat on
the ground.</p>

<p>When the foot is really flattened, it presents two types,
one the <i>flexible flat foot</i>, in which the arch can be restored
by gentle manipulation; the other, the <i>rigid foot</i>, which is
held by structural changes in the position of deformity.</p>

<p>An intermediate type is sometimes seen, in which the
peroneal spasm is so great that the foot is held abducted
and everted as long as the spasm lasts (spastic flat foot.)</p>

<p>Some symptoms of flat foot that are less generally recognized,
which are of great value in diagnosis are: corns,
ingrowing nails, callosities on the sole of the front of the
foot, enlargement of the great-toe joint, and pain (especially
at night) in the calves of the legs and backbone, which is
aggravated by standing and walking.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> The diagnosis of flat foot, whether flexible
or rigid, is made chiefly by inspection. The difficulty comes
in the milder cases, which form the bulk of those seen, and
in which the changes in form are slight.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The symptoms, as described by the patient,
are the most reliable and points of tenderness under the
arch or heel would help to confirm the diagnosis. Some help
may be obtained from a wet impression of the foot, on a
piece of paper, but the slighter cases show but little changes
in the imprint. In most normal feet, the outer border of
the foot touches the paper, and in flat foot, only two areas
bear the weight, one on the inner side of the front of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
foot, and one under the inner part of the heel. An X-ray
picture is often of great assistance.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of rheumatism is frequently made in
flat foot, and is often the source of much misdirected treatment.
Rheumatism should be diagnosed only in connection
with unmistakable symptoms of rheumatism in the upper
extremities.</p>

<p>So-called &#8220;rheumatic&#8221; pains in the knees and hips may
be secondary to flat foot.</p>

<p><b>Prognosis.</b> As a rule, this condition does not recover
spontaneously. Under ordinary conditions, uncomplicated
cases should be at once relieved by proper treatment, and
in time should be cured.</p>

<p>Unfavorable factors are: great weight; disease of the
ankle-joint; the presence of bony spurs under the os calcis.</p>

<p>The prognosis is more favorable in young adults than
in persons of advanced age. Patients, who without relief
have worn the ordinary supports sold at the stores will, as
a rule, manifest extreme sensitiveness as to the fit of any
of the supports which may be applied.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The foot must be restored and held in its
normal position and measures must be adopted to quiet
local irritability or inflammation, and to strengthen the
muscles. The best treatment does not consist in the permanent
wearing of a flat-foot support; the support should
be regarded in the same light as one uses a crutch in a fracture
of the leg.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to all treatment, the use of proper
shoes must be insisted upon. A shoe should be as wide in
front, as the unshod foot, when bearing the weight of the
body.</p>

<p><b>Supports.</b> Flexible supports may be made of boiler
felt; one objection to these is their liability to stretch. They
are of service in young children, in mild cases, and in convalescent
cases where it is desirable to have the patient use
a flexible instead of a stiff support in order to bring the
muscles into play.</p>

<p>Rigid supports are best made of tempered spring steel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
(18 to 20 gage), forged hot to fit a cast of the foot. They
may also be made of phosphor-bronz, celluloid or aluminum.</p>

<p>The shape of the plate is largely a matter of judgment.
The easiest way to determine the shape of the plate to be
used in a given case is to have the patient stand with the
operator&#8217;s hand under the inner side of the foot; the operator
then places the foot in the normal position and notes
where the pressure must be applied to secure the proper
correction; when the anterior part of the foot is flattened,
a slight dome must be constructed in the front of the plate;
when the os calcis is clearly tilted over, the plate must have
two flanges at the heel to hold it in place. In general, the
plate must reach forward to a point just behind the great-toe
joint, and must furnish support as far as the front of
the heel. The plate should be higher on the inner side, and
a flange formation is generally necessary to accomplish
this. An outer flange prevents the foot from slipping off
the outer side of the plate. When the foot no longer requires
support, the plate should be gradually discontinued.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Thomas&#8221; sole may be used in mild cases. This
is made by building up the inner part of the sole of the shoe
one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch higher than the outer
side, thus securing a slight inversion of the foot.</p>

<p>Exercise and massage of the deficient muscles should
form a part of the routine treatment in all cases of flexible
flat foot.</p>

<p>To diminish local inflammation and irritability, the foot
should be soaked in hot water; hot and cold alternate
douches should be applied, and hot-air treatment and massage
should be employed.</p>

<p><b>Rigid Flat Foot.</b> Rigid flat foot cannot be successfully
treated until the position of the foot is corrected. The patient
should be anesthetized, and, by the use of a wedge as
a fulcrum, the bones should be forced into position. A
pressure of about two hundred pounds is generally necessary
to effect this reduction. After this, the foot is placed
in a plaster cast, in extreme adduction and is allowed to
remain thus encased for three weeks. After this, a properly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
fitted plate should be worn. The results are usually satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>Operative Treatment.</b> Cases that have resisted all
other forms of treatment, may be cured by the removal of a
wedge-shaped piece of bone, with the base downward and
inward at the point of greatest inward convexity, that is,
in the neighborhood of the head of the astragalus. Osteotomy
of the front of the os calcis and neck of the astragalus
will at times be necessary for a radical cure.</p>

<p>Many other operative procedures have been advised
for flat foot and they have been employed with varying successes.</p>

<p><b>Hallux Flexus or Hammertoe.</b> The upward prominence
of a toe (usually the second or third) in a rigid position,
is known as <i>hallux flexus</i> or <i>hammertoe</i>. In this
condition the toe is flexed in its second joint so that the end
bears on the ground, while the junction between the phalanges
makes a prominence upward. Helomata and callosities
may develop on the end of the toe, but the chief discomfort
is in the disturbances which arise on the prominence
which presses against the side of the foot-gear.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> A knowledge of the forces at work will
show how futile must be any effort to correct this deformity
by strapping or bandaging. There is a shortening of the
plantar fibres of the lateral ligament of the joint. The
trouble does not lie in the flexor tendons, as it seems, and
operations directed to this point fail. Even with incision of
the lateral ligaments, followed by the application of a
splint, recurrences are common and amputation must be the
procedure.</p>

<p>The condition described as hammertoe may exist in
several or in all of the toes, the great toe being least often
involved. This occurs most often as a result of wearing
improper shoes, but is sometimes the consequence of
paralysis.</p>

<p><b>Flexed or Clawed Toes.</b> Extreme flexion of all but the
great toes causes the weight to be borne by their dorsal
aspect. In this condition the toes, and especially the small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
ones, develop painful helomata on the prominent joints, and
the small toe may become the source of great discomfort.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Radical surgical measures are here indicated.
Tenotomy or amputation is essential to a cure.</p>

<p><b>Painful Heel.</b> Painful heel is a suggestive but unscientific
term applied to tenderness of the under side of the heel.
It is associated with one of the following conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Spurs running out from the under side of the
os calcis found by the aid of the X-ray.</p>

<p>2. Inflammation of the bursae under the os calcis.</p>

<p>3. Flat foot.</p>

<p>4. Gonorrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>5. Focal infection.</p></div>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> Where a spur of bone causes the unpleasant
symptoms, the excrescence should be excised.</p>

<p>When focal infections are the primary cause of painful
heel, operative procedure to remove the source of infection
is imperative and will prove curative.</p>

<p>Palliative measures are: massage, douches, hot air, a
metal plate worn under the painful area, rest. The back
of the foot should be cut away to relieve pressure.</p>

<p><b>Metatarsalgia&#8212;Morton&#8217;s Disease.</b> Metatarsalgia is
characterized by an acute pain, cramplike in character, occurring
at the base of the third or fourth toes.</p>

<p>The pain comes on suddenly while the foot is in action,
and is usually accompanied by a &#8220;snapping of the bones.&#8221;
The pain is so acute that it is not uncommon for the patient
to seek relief by taking off the shoe and rubbing the
foot.</p>

<p>In persons suffering with this condition it will be regularly
noticed that the weight is thrown upon the ball of the
foot, on the metatarsophalangeal joints, either because of
a weak foot, or because of a tendency of the toes to turn up.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> 1. Proper strapping to raise the arch and
bring the ends of the toes down.</p>

<p>2. A pad across the ball of the foot <i>behind</i> the metatarsal
heads, also brings the toes down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Recommend shoes, wide across the ball, with a higher
or lower heel than ordinary, as the case indicates.</p>

<p><b>Hallux Valgus.</b> The term <i>hallux valgus</i> is applied to a
deviation or displacement of the great toe outward, toward
the outer border of the foot.</p>

<p>In normal feet, the line of the great toe when prolonged
backward, should pass through the centre of the heel. This
relation in civilized communities is seen only in the feet of
infants. In adults it is observable only in the bare-footed
races.</p>

<p><b>Cause.</b> It is frequently associated with flat foot, gout
and rheumatism, but it is primarily due to the use of inappropriate
foot-gear. It is only considered pathologic when
the deviation is more than fifteen degrees.</p>

<p><b>Pathology.</b> The displacement outward (which reaches
30 to 40 degrees in the average case and may reach 90 degrees)
of the phalangeal part of the great-toe joint, uncovers
the inner part of the head of the metartarsal bone, and here
the cartilage degenerates, and the bone becomes condensed
at its outer part. The inner lateral ligament is lengthened
and thickened and the sesamoid bones become displaced outward
and are often thickened.</p>

<p>Under the skin, at the inner and prominent aspect of
the foot, is to be found a bursa, which is liable to inflammation
under pressure, and is known as a bunion. The inflammation
in this sac may extend to the joint and thus
disintegrate it.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> The toe is displaced outward and a reddened
and shiny condition of the thickened skin exists over
the inner prominence and perhaps over the top of the toe
joint. The great toe if seriously displaced, must lie over
or under the other toes, the former being the more common
position. In other cases the second toe may be crowded up
as a hammertoe. The joint is painful and the inner toes,
being crowded to the outer side of the foot, are the seat of
corns and callosities. Flat foot is frequently associated
with this condition.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In mild cases, the stocking should be split
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
to allow a separate stall for the great toe, and broad toed
boots should be worn. If flat foot exists, a support should
be supplied for its aid in restoring the position of the great
toe. In severe cases, nothing short of an operation is likely to
be of value. A toe-post may be worn for a time in mild cases.</p>

<p>Amputation of the head of the metatarsal bone gives
uniformly good results.</p>

<p>The toe is straightened and flexible; ankylosis with this
operation does not occur.</p>

<p>In operations for hallux valgus there are two distinct
purposes acting as determining factors in making a choice
in a given case as to which is indicated. These are: (1)the
radical operation for the correction of the deformity, and
(2)the palliative operation for the alleviation of symptoms
by the removal of the hypertrophied portion of the metatarsal
head which is exposed to pressure. Among operations
in the first mentioned class, the one known as the Mayo operation
is, in all probability, the best. The entire head of
the metatarsal is amputated, and the bursa is turned in over
the cut end of bone, to diminish the amount of shortening
and to prevent ankylosis of the joint. This latter consideration,
however, is an unnecessary one, for in operations
within this joint, ankylosis does not occur when the synovial
surface of the phalanx is left undisturbed, even when the
bursa is not employed as an intervening pad.</p>

<p>In the other class of operations for the relief of symptoms,
no attempt is made to straighten the toe. A wedge-shaped
piece of the exostosis is removed, against which
pressure has caused symptoms.</p>

<p>A palliative operation devised by Dr. Robert T. Morris
of this city, is one easy of accomplishment and serves every
purpose where a radical operation is interdicted. It is
known as the &#8220;button-hole&#8221; operation because of the fact
that only a small incision is made immediately above the
protuberant bone through which a sharp chisel is inserted,
cutting off the offending &#8220;button&#8221; of bone.</p>

<p>An operation which in the hands of the authors has
proven of distinct value, and which has probably not been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
previously described eliminates both the deformity and its
painful symptoms. This operation which is described below,
is less severe than other radical operations and not very
much more so than the usual palliative ones.</p>

<p>The incision is made on the dorsum of the great toe
over the offending joint and just to the inner side of the
extensor tendon. This tendon is held to the outer side, out
of the way. The knife penetrates the capsule of the joint
and opens it above and laterally.</p>

<p>An effort is made to preserve the integrity of the capsule
below (floor) as <i>only the intra capsular end of the
metatarsal is removed</i>. These two factors are of the utmost
importance. When the joint capsule is slit open along its
dorsal and two lateral aspects, sufficient room is obtained
for the insertion of the wire saw, and all of that portion of
the metatarsal lying within the joint proper is removed.
There is thus accomplished a correction of the deformity
with very little shortening of the great toe. Usually its
length after this operation is about the same as the second
toe.</p>

<p>The next step in the operation is closure of the synovial
sac or joint capsule. A stitch on either side and two above
are all that is necessary. The floor of the sac remains intact
and nothing beneath it, in the ball of the foot, has been
disturbed. Many operators invade this area and remove
the sesamoids. This is unwarranted as the transverse level
of the ball of the foot is lost, and the weight is put directly
upon the newly formed joint, depriving it of its normal
support, or of padding from below.</p>

<p>One other omission in this operation is that of the bursal
flap over the raw end. This is found entirely unnecessary
as results prove, and its omission hastens healing considerably.
The bursa over the metatarsophalangeal articulation
in these cases is nearly always inflamed, and consists
of a mere fibrous pad. Its dissection from the normal position
is a real loss at that site, and of questionable benefit
over the cut bone, as motion in the joint is as good or better
without it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The skin closure is made without drainage, and <i>no wet
dressing employed</i> for fear of the solution filling the cavity
whence the bone was removed and carrying with it infectious
material. A dry sterile dressing is all that is required,
and a splint to maintain a straight position for the toe.</p>

<p>Four or five days complete rest for the part are ordinarily
sufficient. Following this, walking about the room is
permitted with the aid of a stick. After ten days, when the
patient can get about fairly well without the assistance of
a stick, the foot may safely be shod with an &#8220;arctic&#8221; of
sufficient size.</p>

<h4><b>CLUBFOOT OR TALIPES</b></h4>

<p>The most common form of clubfoot, and therefore the
deformity of that character most frequently encountered,
is characterized by inversion of the sole of the foot, elevation
of the heel, and a twisting and turning of the front
part of the foot. This deformity is typical of <i>congenital</i>
clubfoot, which, as stated, is the most common form of that
deformity. The <i>acquired</i> form is usually the result of infantile
paralysis.</p>

<p><b>Congenital Clubfoot</b> is most frequently double, and
males are more frequently affected than females; in unilateral
or one-sided clubfoot, one side is not more frequently
affected than the other.</p>

<p><b>Etiology.</b> Very little is known as to the cause of congenital
clubfoot but it is not infrequently associated with
other congenital deformities. It appears to be hereditary
in a great many instances. The greater number of cases
appear without definable cause, except perhaps from intra-uterine
pressure. There are, however, a number of these
cases that are associated with malformation of the bones of
the foot and leg, such as absence of the scaphoid; defect of
the tibia; fusion of a number of the tarsal bones.</p>

<p><b>Pathology.</b> The sharp adduction and plantar flexion,
at the tarsal joints, produce a deformed position of the
foot. As a result of these, the heel is small and elevated;
the dorsum of the foot is prominent; and the outer border
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
usually, and, in extreme cases, the dorsum of the foot, bears
the weight of the body in walking and in standing; the sole
of the foot is bent sharply in, and twisted at the tarsal
joint. In fact, all the bones are changed in shape, and the
inner muscles, tendons and ligaments are shortened by contraction,
while the ones to the outer side are lengthened.</p>

<p>The distortion of certain individual bones is of importance.
The astragalus is the seat of the most important
changes. It is tipped downward at its front end, and its
posterior part articulates with the tibia, its anterior articular
surface projecting under the skin; its neck is elongated
and bent inward and downward, so that its scaphoid articulation
faces inward and downward and not forward.</p>

<p>This is the most important change in clubfoot, because
the anterior end of the astragalus, the head of the bone,
carries inward and downward with it the scaphoid, the three
cuneiforms, and the inner three metatarsal bones. The
scaphoid articulates with the inner side rather than the
front of the astragalus and, in extreme cases, forms a joint
surface with the inner malleolus. It may be somewhat
changed in shape, being flattened and drawn inward and
upward.</p>

<p>The os calcis is generally poorly developed, and its
front end is rotated downward, and bent inward; the outer
surface of the bone is more convex and the inner surface
more concave than normal, and since the anterior facet
looks inward and downward, it carries with it the cuboid
and the two external metatarsal bones. The changes in the
other bones are not important; the chief obstacles to reduction
lie in the os calcis and in the astragalus.</p>

<p><b>Soft Parts.</b> The muscles, ligaments, tendons, and fascia
at the lower and inner side of the foot are shortened, and
lengthened at the outer and upper side. The plantar fascia
being one of the chief obstacles to reduction, the tendons
are displaced, especially those on the inner side of the foot.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b> Double clubfoot is usually accompanied
by an awkward and unsteady gait, in which each foot is in
turn lifted high to clear the foot on the ground, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
<i>toeing in</i> is, of course, excessive. The weight is borne on
the outer side of the foot, and all elasticity of gait is absent.</p>

<p>On the outer border of the foot, where the weight is
borne, callosities and bursae develop; the calves of the legs
are small, and the knee joint may be lax.</p>

<p>The gait in single clubfoot is less awkward, but characterized
by the same features. The foot is rigid in the deformed
position, and in cases of marked deformity, the foot
cannot be manipulated into the normal position.</p>

<p><b>Diagnosis.</b> Congenital clubfoot cannot be mistaken for
any other condition. The diagnosis is self-evident.</p>

<p><b>Prognosis.</b> There is no tendency of this deformity to
right itself, or to improve. Early and proper treatment
will, if continued long enough, insure a cure in children and
an improvement in adult cases; but it must be remembered
that there is a decided tendency to relapse, even after operation,
unless the foot is kept in an overcorrected position
for a number of years.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> In young infants, treatment should be
begun as early as two weeks after birth and should consist
in frequent gentle massage and manipulations. After the
part can be brought into an overcorrected position by gentle
manipulation, it should be put up in a plaster cast, for a
period of three weeks and this treatment should be continued
until the position of the foot is corrected.</p>

<p>The manipulations consist in grasping the dorsum of
the foot gently but firmly with one hand, and holding the
leg with the other. The foot is then dorsally flexed and
everted. This treatment should be repeated at least three
times a day and should not be rough enough to cause the
infant to cry.</p>

<p>Treatment of clubfoot in older children and adults is a
much more difficult proposition and consists in the combination
of two or more methods of procedure.</p>

<p>In order to correct the extreme adduction in these cases,
extreme force must sometimes be employed. This may be
accomplished by bending and bearing down on the foot, with
its outer border resting on the apex of a wooden wedge.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
The rotation of the foot is corrected by grasping the foot
in one hand, and the heel in the other, and twisting with
the necessary amount of force. The inversion of the sole
is also corrected by the use of this wedge as a fulcrum.</p>

<p>In this way the tendo Achillis and the plantar fascia
are stretched, and the dorsal flexion is secured by laying
the patient on the face with the knee bent and the front of
the thigh resting on the table. The lower leg is then vertical,
and by bearing down on the front of the foot with
the necessary amount of force, dorsal flexion of the foot is
secured, and by hooking the fingers around the os calcis,
its position is improved.</p>

<p>A modified Thomas wrench may be used in the correction
of clubfoot; but this must be done with great care, as
the violence practised in this method, the tearing of the
ligaments and other soft parts, is often attended with great
danger; osteomyelitis, tuberculosis, neuritis, and even
death from fat embolism, and extensive sloughing of the
soft parts are not infrequently seen after the use of this
and other bone crushing instruments.</p>

<p>The removal of a wedge of bone from the outer side
of the foot and the removal of the neck of the astragalus
are employed. Tenotomy and the transplantation of tendons
are also often practised, when other methods of treatment
fail.</p>

<p><b>Acquired Clubfoot.</b> The cause of acquired clubfoot
maybe infantile paralysis, joint disease, traumatism, or it
may be due to affections of the brain or spinal cord.</p>

<p><b>Paralysis.</b> Infantile paralysis affecting the muscles of
the front and outer side of the lower leg, will result in a
condition similar to congenital clubfoot. Other paralytic
causes are: spastic or cerebral paralysis, hereditary
ataxia, etc.</p>

<p><b>Traumatic.</b> A condition resembling clubfoot may result
from improperly treated fractures of the ankle-joint
or tarsal bones.</p>

<p><b>Joint Disease.</b> In tuberculosis, arthritis deformans,
and other diseases of the ankle-joint, a condition similar to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
clubfoot is sometimes seen as a result of muscular contraction.</p>

<p><b>Talipes Equinus</b> is rarely congenital. It is usually due
to infantile paralysis of the extensor muscles, or to cicatrical
contraction of the calf muscles, as a complication of
hip disease. It varies from inability to flex the ankle beyond
a right angle, to walking on the heads of the metatarsal
bones. The astragalus is partially displaced forward
and forms a prominence on the dorsum of the foot; the
plantar fascia is shortened and callosities and bursae are
formed under the heads of the metatarsal bones. Primarily,
the obstacle to reduction is the tense Achilles tendon, and
in advanced cases the shortened plantar fascia and posterior
ligament of the ankle-joint constitute obstacles.</p>

<p><b>Talipes Equino-Varis</b> (down and in foot) is the most
common form of this deformity.</p>

<p>It is either congenital or acquired, and in the latter
case it is due to infantile paralysis of the extensor and
peroneal muscles. The heel is drawn up, and the anterior
half of the font is drawn inwards and inverted. The inner
border of the foot is shortened, and in neglected cases the
patient walks on the outer side of the cuboid, under which
a bursa is formed. Secondary contraction of the plantar
fascia, ligaments, and short plantar muscles follows. There
is a great increase in the obliquity of the neck of the astragalus
in congenital cases, so that the scaphoid and anterior
half of the foot, together with the dorsal tendons are
carried inward. As a result of the equinus, the upper surface
of the astragalus projects forward, and only its posterior
portion comes in contact with the tibia and fibula.
The ligaments of the inner side of the foot are shortened
and the shape of the other tarsal bones is secondarily
altered.</p>

<p><b>Talipes Equino-Valgus</b> (down and out foot). This condition
is rare as a congenital deformity. The anterior half
of the foot is deflected outward, and the inner border comes
in contact with the ground. The scaphoid is placed outward,
and the head of the astragalus projects into the sole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The acquired variety results from paralysis of the
tibialis posticus and flexors, with secondary contraction of
the peronei muscles.</p>

<p><b>Talipes Calcaneus</b> is rare as a congenital deformity.
It is usually the result of infantile paralysis of the muscles
of the calf. The patient walks on the heel, and the anterior
half of the foot is drawn up. Valgus or varus are associated
with it; the more common form is talipes calcaneo-valgus.</p>

<p><b>Talipes Cavus</b> (Pes Cavus), or hollow foot, is a condition
in which the arch of the foot is greatly exaggerated.
It is rarely congenital but is frequently seen in connection
with clubfoot, especially in its paralytic forms. In its
mildest form, it exists in a highly arched foot, often hereditary.
It may also be the result of too short shoes (Chinese
ladies&#8217; foot).</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b> The condition is best remedied by division
of the contracted soft parts, a forcible reduction of the
bones, held in place by plaster of Paris. When the patient
begins to walk, it is advisable to have a stiff, flat, steel plate
placed in the length of the shoe between the layers of the
leather sole, running from which, over the dorsum of the
foot, is a stout leather strap. At each step, downward pressure
is thus exerted on the dorsum of the foot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><b>THERAPEUTIC MEASURES</b></h3>

<h4><b>HYPEREMIA</b></h4>

<p><b>Hyperemia</b> as a therapeutic agent was described by
Bier and is of two kinds, <i>active</i> and <i>passive</i>. The former
is the same as the <i>arterial</i>, while the latter is the <i>venous</i>.
Between the blood of active and passive hyperemia there
are important physical and chemical differences, the one
containing much free oxygen with but little carbonic acid
and alkali, while the other presents the exactly opposite
character.</p>

<p>In active hyperemia normal elements of the blood
are kept in active motion, while in the passive form they
are allowed to escape, more or less, into the tissues.</p>

<p>Hyperemia possesses a great many properties:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. Power to diminish pain.</div>>
<div class="line">2. Bactericidal action.</div>
<div class="line">3. Absorptive property.</div>
<div class="line">4. Solvent action.</div>
<div class="line">5. Nutritive power.</div>
<div class="line">6. Suppression of the infection.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hyperemia may be produced in three ways; <i>first</i>, by
means of the elastic bandage or band; <i>second</i>, by cupping
glasses, and <i>third</i>, by hot air. The first two produce venous
or passive hyperemia, and the third, arterial or active
hyperemia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Passive Hyperemia.</b> This obstructive hyperemia is produced
by means of a thin, soft rubber elastic bandage, two
or three inches in width, better known as the Esmarch, or
Martin bandage. When this is applied moderately tight
around a limb about six or eight turns, one layer overlapping
the other, pressure is evenly distributed over a comparatively
wide area, causing the subcutaneous veins below
the constriction to swell; the extremity becomes somewhat
bluish red in color, also larger and edematous, giving a feeling
of warmth to the touch.</p>

<p>The rubber bandage, properly applied, should not
cause any uncomfortable feeling and there should be absolutely
no pain present. At all times one must be able to
feel the pulse below the site of the bandage. If the bandage
is applied too tight, the skin of the limb looks grayish-blue
and there appear whitish, or vermilion colored spots,
which grow larger and larger, as long as the too tightly
drawn bandage is on. Paresthesia and pain, with disappearance
of the pulse, can also be noted.</p>

<p>The two cardinal rules to be observed in the application
of the bandage are: (1) absolutely no pain with the
application of the bandage; (2) the pulse at all times must
be felt below the bandage.</p>

<p>In cases which require the bandage to remain in place
from sixteen to twenty hours each day, it will be necessary
to first apply a soft flannel bandage underneath the rubber
one in order to prevent pressure necrosis.</p>

<p>Frequently changing the location of the bandage up
and down the extremity, and treating the skin with alcohol
rubs, will also be helpful to patients with a tender skin.
The elastic bandage must always be placed upon a healthy
area, proximal to the diseased part. All dressings should
be removed while the compressing bandage is on, in order
that the part may become hyperemic.</p>

<p>Wounds or sinuses are covered with sterile gauze and
kept in place with a towel, fastened with a few safety pins.</p>

<p>In acute inflammation, septic wounds and phlegmons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the increased inflammation is apt to frighten the beginner,
but this is a desired phase of the treatment.</p>

<p>As a prophylatic against infection, it cleanses the
wound, produces a local immunization and reaction before
the infection has a chance to work; the earlier the bandage
is applied the more remarkable is the effect.</p>

<p>For incised wounds of the foot with division of the
muscles and tendons, if the tissues are not too seriously injured,
the muscles and tendons should be united and the
skin closed with interrupted sutures sufficiently far apart
to allow free excretion. No drainage is employed and a
slight compressing dressing is applied. The elastic bandage
is applied very lightly, producing only a slight venous
engorgement and the bandage should remain on from ten
to eighteen hours a day.</p>

<p>As soon us the symptoms of acute inflammation subside,
the time of application of the bandage is reduced. If
signs of suppuration are present, the wound should be
promptly opened and the pus evacuated. The knife takes
care of the pus; hyperemic treatment fights the infection.</p>

<p>In gonorrhoeal arthritis of acute or chronic nature, and
in cases of tuberculosis of the bones and joints, the passive
form of hyperemia is especially indicated.</p>

<p>The use of cupping glasses is limited to abscesses,
furuncles and sinuses.</p>

<p><b>Active Hyperemia</b>, or arterial hyperemia, is produced
by means of hot-air boxes such as the Tyrnauer electric apparatus,
or the gas apparatus of Betz.</p>

<p>Active hyperemia increases the arterial blood to any
part of the body, thus favoring the absorption of chronic
exudates, infiltrates, adhesions, etc. Dry, hot air permits
the use of a high degree of temperature without injury or
pain to the respective part.</p>

<p>For neuritis of the foot, ulcers, especially diabetic,
perforating and varicose, and for the stiffness following a
chronic inflammation, or after a fracture, the arterial form
of hyperemia gives good results.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<h4><b>COLD</b></h4>

<p><b>Cold</b>, or the rapid abstraction of heat, is a remedial
measure that is nearly always available and is possessed of
very great power for good in selected cases.</p>

<p>When cold is applied for its limited and local action, it
is always used with two objects in view, namely, (1) to
cause localized contraction of the blood vessels, which
through inflammation are engorged, so that the parts are
swollen and reddened; or (2) temporarily to anesthetize or
benumb the nerve terminals, for the immediate relief of
pain, in the hope that the temporary paralysis may ultimately
result in such changes as to produce a cure.</p>

<p>Cold, in some form, is a popular remedy for a sprain,
or any injury likely to be followed by inflammatory processes.
A very useful remedy for the sprain of an ankle,
when it is a recent accident, is to let the patient sit with the
foot elevated, with a cloth wrung out in ice water, and an
ice bag applied over the affected part.</p>

<p>In the treatment of localized pain or inflammation, cold
is used in a number of ways, largely depending upon the
will of the physician and the means of the patient. The
simplest, cheapest, and perhaps the best method of using
cold, is to place cracked ice in a rubber bag, the latter to
be thoroughly watertight, lay it over the inflamed part, surrounding
it with a towel so as to prevent the moisture,
which appears on the surface from condensation, from wetting
the clothing.</p>

<h4><b>HEAT</b></h4>

<p><b>Heat</b> is used locally for a number of purposes in the
same manner as cold, and the choice of heat or cold in the
treatment of any acute form of inflammation depends almost
entirely upon the wish of the patient, who generally
can tell at once which will give him the greater comfort.</p>

<p>In sprains of the ankle, nothing compares to a hot foot-bath
prolonged for hours, the object being to decrease the
pain and swelling, thereby regaining the use of the limb.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The high degree of heat which can be borne by gradually
increasing the temperature of the water by the addition
of small quantities of scalding water, is extraordinary,
and the favorable results obtained are in direct ratio
to the height of the temperature.</p>

<p>Between these soakings, the part should be dressed
with lead and opium wash, and rubbed with ichthyol ointment
or camphor liniment.</p>

<p>Hot-water bottles or bags are also used locally for the
relief of congestion and pain.</p>

<h4><b>THE HIGH FREQUENCY CURRENT, OR VIOLET RAY</b></h4>

<p><b>The Violet Ray or High Frequency Current</b> is one which
is in a rapid state of to-and-fro vibration and is applied
through vacuum glass attachments or electrodes, which are
excited to a beautiful violet color. The discharge may appear
to the eye to be a single spark, but it is made up of a
number of successive sparks, following each other with such
extreme rapidity that they are said to oscillate (change
directions) millions of times per second, a speed that the
eye cannot note. The rapid oscillations have the effect of
producing the following phenomena:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. the high frequency current is unipolar, that is,
does not require a complete circuit.</p>

<p>2. glass does not insulate the high frequency current
as it does ordinary electricity.</p>

<p>3. the high frequency current generates enormous
quantities of ozone during its flow.</p>

<p>4. the current does not produce any pain.</p>

<p>5. the high frequency current produces a cellular
massage.</p></div>

<p>The contractile effect is expended upon the individual
cells making up the tissues, instead of on individual muscles.</p>

<p>If a sedative effect is desired, keep the electrode in
contact with the part; if a stimulating effect is desired,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
hold the electrode away from the surface; the farther away,
the longer the spark.</p>

<p>A uniform spark of any length can be produced by
administering the current through layers of toweling, or
through the clothing; the length of the spark depends upon
the thickness of the layers.</p>

<p>The use of the high frequency current in surgery is
limited to sprains, stiff joints, neuritic pains, and adhesions
due to inflammatory exudates. Fulguration for the destruction
of growths is obtained by employing a pointed metal
electrode.</p>

<h4><b>RUBEFACIENTS</b></h4>

<p><b>Rubefacients.</b> These are agents which revulse by
causing congestion of the skin:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <b>Turpentine.</b> A few teaspoonfuls of oil of turpentine
sprinkled over a piece of flannel wrung out of hot water,
applied to the skin and covered with oiled silk or dry flannel,
constitutes the turpentine stupe. Twenty minutes is the
maximum for this application.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <b>Mustard.</b> Mustard flour (the black being the
stronger), mixed with tepid water into a paste, spread
thinly on a piece of muslin or paper, and covered with gauze
or thin cambric, is an excellent counterirritant. Few skins
will bear pure black mustard for more than ten minutes.
Mustard, diluted one-half with wheat or corn flour, and
allowed to stand for twenty minutes, should be the maximum
strength for application, because blistering must be avoided,
that produced by mustard being specially painful. After
removing a mustard plaster, greased lint should be applied.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>Mustard Foot-Bath.</b> A mustard foot-bath consists
of one or two tablespoonfuls of pure mustard in a bucket
two-thirds full of water at 105&deg;F; the feet may be kept
in this for about twenty minutes, a blanket being thrown
around the limbs, and including the bucket, to retain the
heat.</p>

<p>Revulsives must be used with caution in cases of shock
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
or coma, lest impaired vitality or sensation to pain result
in extensive sloughing of the skin.</p>

<h4><b>CAUTERIES</b></h4>

<p><b>The Actual Cautery</b> is used in the form of variously
shaped irons, hatchet-edged, round, or olivary, fitted into
wooden handles, and heated in a charcoal furnace.</p>

<p>As a counterirritant, the iron should be heated only
to a dull red heat, and should be quickly drawn in parallel
lines, about one inch apart, over the skin, avoiding all bony
prominences. Compresses wet with cold water, or with some
antiseptic lotion, may then be applied.</p>

<p><b>The Paquellin Thermo-Cautery</b> is a convenient form.
It consists of hollow platinum cauteries and a handle covered
with wood; a benzole reservoir; a pair of rubber bulbs, like
those for a hand-spray apparatus, connected by a tube with
the reservoir; a long rubber tube to connect the cautery
handle also with the reservoir; and a spirit-lamp with
attached blow-pipe.</p>

<p>Screwing on the desired point, the tube from the
reservoir is slipped over the handle; the point is heated in
the lamp; is removed from the flame; and, compressing the
bulbs, which should previously have been connected with
the reservoir, benzole vapor is forced into the point, which
will heat up, and can be maintained at any temperature by
the rapidity with which the bulb is worked. If the point
will not heat with the simple flame, attach the bulbs to the
blow-pipe on the lamp, and, compressing them, heat the
cautery to a bright-red heat, and then connect with the
reservoir and proceed as before directed.</p>

<p><b>Galvano-Cautery.</b> This requires a battery of a few
large elements closely coupled, and various curets, knives,
and ecraseurs fitting into insulated handles. The chief
advantage of this form of cautery is the possibility of placing
the instrument in position while cold, and then heating it.</p>

<p>Where hemorrhage is undesirable, a dull-red heat should
be maintained, for at a white heat the tissues are divided as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
if with a knife, and bleeding follows. When the ecraseur is
used, needles must be passed at right angles through the
healthy tissues, the platinum wire placed behind these, and
the wire, at a dull-red heat, slowly tightened.</p>

<h4><b>ELECTRICITY</b></h4>

<p><b>Electricity.</b> This is used in the form of the <i>induced current</i>
(Faradism) to exercise and improve the nutrition of
muscles, and in the form of the <i>constant current</i> (galvanism)
along the course of nerve-trunks, to excite their conducting
power, or to act as a sedative in neuralgias.</p>

<p>The same current is used to induce chemical decomposition
(<i>electrolysis</i>) or to cauterize and destroy tissue by
heating an encircling wire or by a galvanic knife. Franklinic,
or static electricity, is also occasionally used.</p>

<p><b>Electrolysis.</b> For electrolysis a galvanic battery of
thirty or more medium-sized cells is required, with needle
electrodes insulated, except near their points.</p>

<p>To destroy a verruca, introduce into it two needles, a
short distance apart, each connected with a pole of the
battery; then, commencing with a weak current, this must
be cautiously increased, the sitting lasting from a half hour
to one hour, after which the needles are to be removed and
the punctures sealed by collodion.</p>

<h4><b>MASSAGE</b></h4>

<p><b>Massage.</b> This is employed to stimulate the circulation
in the part mechanically; to loosen tissues bound down by
adhesions; to diffuse inflammatory exudates over a wider
area, thus favoring their absorption; and to change the
rate of the circulation to a point compatible with rapid
absorption and normal nutrition.</p>

<p>Four distinct varieties of manipulation are found to be
most generally useful:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="list">
<div class="line">1. rubbing, or stroking</div>
<div class="line">2. kneading</div>
<div class="line">3. tapping, or percussion.</div>
<div class="line">4. passive and active moments.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stroking</i> consists in gentle rubbing directed from the
periphery upward, commencing the process above the inflamed
part and continuing it over the diseased area; the
pressure, at first light but finally firmer, will force the
exudates into the tissues above, which have been emptied
by the preparatory rubbing.</p>

<p><i>Kneading</i> means rubbing the part circularly with the
pulps of the fingers and the thumb or the palm of the hand,
and is best combined with pinching up of the skin or muscles
singly or together, and gently rolling them between the
fingers and palms.</p>

<p><i>Percussion</i> is effected by tapping the surface over the
diseased part with the tips of all the fingers held on a level,
or with the ulnar side of the hands, or, after covering the
part with a towel, three parallel pieces of stiff rubber tubing,
fixed in a handle (a muscle beater), may be employed,
gently striking the part transversely to its long axis.</p>

<p><i>Passive movements</i> should be made at the close of each
sitting if a joint is concerned.</p>

<p>Massage is sometimes advisable twice daily, but often
once a day or every other day is better; each sitting may
last from fifteen minutes to one hour.</p>

<h4><b>EXAMINATION BY RADIOGRAPHY</b></h4>

<p><b>X-Ray Examination.</b> This method of examination depends
on the property of penetration of matter possessed
by a radiation from an electrically excited Crookes&#8217; tube.
This radiation has been proved to lie outside the spectrum,
and has been named X-ray.</p>

<p>It may, for purposes other than those required by the
expert, be looked upon as a source of light which has the
property of penetrating the tissues to a greater or less
extent according to their density, and the shadows cast by it
can be recorded on a photographic plate, or may be viewed
with the naked eye by means of a screen composed of a thin
layer of barium platinocyanide, a substance which becomes
highly fluorescent in the presence of this radiation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>One or the other of these methods is used for the
recognition of pathologic conditions existing in the human
tissues.</p>

<p>The fluorescent screen appears at first sight to be an easy
way of recognizing abnormalities. Its value in the examination
of the thorax, where the movements of the heart, lungs,
and diaphragm have to be observed, is undoubtedly very
great; but as an accurate means of recognizing any abnormality,
it is untrustworthy. For instance, it is possible
to fail to recognize simple transverse fracture of the tibia
by its means. Its use is therefore to be deprecated in cases
where great accuracy is necessary, and it is safer and better
to make use of the more certain method, the photographic
plate.</p>

<p>A further objection to the use of the screen is that the
constant exposure of the hands and other parts of the body
of the observer may result in an intractable, dangerous and
chronic dermatitis.</p>

<p>By using a photographic plate the danger of dermatitis
can be avoided, since it is not necessary to expose the hands
at all; and at the same time greater accuracy is ensured and
a permanent record is obtained.</p>

<p>Although examination by radiography is a somewhat
tedious procedure in comparison with direct observation by
the fluorescent screen, yet it is less difficult if the photographic
side of this method is approached in a proper and
businesslike manner.</p>

<p><b>Interpretation of Radiograms.</b> A successful result in
X-ray examination involves a clear understanding of the
meaning of the radiogram produced. Even with the most
accurate knowledge of anatomy, it is difficult to interpret
X-ray shadows; for a radiogram is only a shadow, and the
outline of the part thus demonstrated is liable to great
variation. For example, in the case of injury to bone, it is
always possible to secure strong and accurate X-ray shadows
of the part, and no error ought to be made in diagnosis,
yet errors of this kind are not uncommon.</p>

<p>To avoid such mistakes, it is imperative that the quality
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of the radiogram secured should be the best possible. For
instance, in the examination of the ankle-joint and the bones
of the foot, a radiogram which is flat, indistinct, and altogether
wanting in detail, is of no value, while a radiogram
of good quality of the same ankle-joint and foot, is of value.
The interpretation of the latter is easy, while that of the
former would be almost impossible, and certainly inaccurate.</p>

<p>The usual practice in securing radiograms is to place
the subject in a position considered likely to give the best
results, and then roughly, almost at random, to place the
tube in some unknown relation to the part of the body
under examination. The resulting shadow is often of no
value because it is wanting in detail and depth. One method
of avoiding this fault is to produce stereoscopic views of
the part examined.</p>

<p>Two views having been secured in stereoscopic register,
and placed in a stereoscope, the part can be viewed in relief.
Theoretically, then, by this means one is able to view the
parts of the body opaque to the X-rays as they would appear
to the naked eye. In practice, however, this method, though
it may prove of value in exceptional circumstances, is
laborious. Moreover, though the parts may be made to
appear in relief, they are not really as one would see them
with the naked eye, but are still X-ray shadows.</p>

<p>A more practical method is to ensure that in all cases
radiograms of any part of the body be absolutely comparable
with one another by taking care to maintain the same relationship
between the X-ray tube and the part under examination.
For example, in making an examination of the ankle-joint,
the limb is placed in a prescribed position, and the
anode of the X-ray tube, that is, the actual source of the
X-ray, is brought into accurate relationship to the tip of
the internal malleolus by a simple mechanical contrivance,
the details of which need not be dealt with here. This
relationship between the tube and the ankle can always be
reproduced, and therefore the shadow of a normal ankle-joint
can always be obtained under the same conditions for
comparison with the radiogram of the suspected ankle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way, not only is the surgeon able to select the
view of the part which will have the depth and detail
necessary for proper interpretation, but, the shadow being
familiar, he can more easily recognize any abnormality.</p>

<p>A radiogram secured under the conditions usually
adopted, shows definite and known anatomic relationship
between the bones and the X-ray tube, namely, with the
anode of the tube directly opposite the tip of the internal
malleolus.</p>

<p>To render this method of examination more perfect,
there has been devised a system of radiography containing
a definition of the relationships between the tube and the
various parts of the body which have been found to give
the most useful views, and also radiograms of the normal
appearances of each part at the ages respectively of 5, 15,
and 25 years.</p>

<p>By using this system the surgeon can secure a radiogram
of any part of the body, of the requisite standard in
quality, while he has at hand a normal radiogram of that
part for comparison with the abnormal.</p>

<p>Having secured a radiogram of good quality, it is necessary
for the purpose of interpretation that it should be
viewed in a suitable light. The best for the purpose is a
bright light shaded with opal in a dark room. The negative
may be viewed at its best while still wet. Considerable loss
of detail follows the taking of prints, which for this reason
may greatly detract from the value of the radiogram.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that X-ray examination in
the diagnosis of diseases can replace the older and well-tried
clinical methods of investigation; it is merely a useful
means of acquiring knowledge which, in conjunction with
accurate clinical investigation, leads to a more accurate
diagnosis and prognosis, and is often most useful by suggesting
a more suitable line of treatment. It must be remembered
that this method of investigation has been in
use only a comparatively short time. In some diseases no
definite statement is yet possible that may not prove in the
future to be misleading.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>At present the therapeutic use of the X-ray is rightly
falling into the hands of the dermatologist and the medical
clinician. In surgery, outside of the conditions mentioned
above, its use is limited to lupus, keloid, epithelioma, sarcoma
and carcinoma, both before and after operation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DRESSINGS AND BANDAGING; SOLUTIONS
AND OINTMENTS; SKIN
GRAFTING</h3>

<h4><b>DRESSINGS</b></h4>

<p><b>Dressings.</b> These may be either dry or wet.</p>

<p><i>Dry dressings</i> consist of gauze and bandage or of
cotton and collodion (the cocoon dressing.)</p>

<p>The most convenient form in which sterile gauze can
be obtained is in small squares in individual envelopes.
Large packages are contaminated with the first opening and
are inconvenient.</p>

<p>The cocoon dressing is occlusive and should never be
applied over an infected area. It is applicable to sensitive
areas for protection, and to operated areas not liable to
infection.</p>

<p>Protective varnishes, such as collodion, compound tincture
of benzoin, or pure ichthyol, are useful where little
protection is indicated.</p>

<p><i>Wet dressings.</i> Two distinct therapeutic actions may
be derived from the wet compress, depending upon whether
or not an impervious covering is employed. These actions
are <i>antiphlogistic</i> and <i>hyperemic</i>, and these in turn may be
either <i>antiseptic</i> or <i>astringent</i>. The wet dressing, without a
covering, is cleansing and heat reducing, because of evaporation.
There should be frequent replenishment of the solution
in the treatment of any infected wound or where it is
desirable to reduce inflammation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>A wet dressing with an impervious covering is contraindicated
in the presence of pus, the warmth and moisture
of such a dressing being congenial to the growth and to the
multiplication of bacteria.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that a wet dressing with an
impervious covering can safely be employed only in conditions
where the skin is unbroken, such as sprains and
bruises.</p>

<p>The two general therapeutic actions, aside from those
of causing hyperemia, are antiseptic and astringent. For
the relief of pain and for the reduction of inflammation,
wet dressings are the most effective form of treatment
because (1) they are aseptic; (2) they permit free drainage;
(3) no new granulations are disturbed in changing the
dressing.</p>

<p>A great many different solutions are used and among
these are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. sterile water;</p>

<p>2. ordinary saline solution (a teaspoonful of salt
to a pint of water);</p>

<p>3. saturated solution of boric acid (prepared by
dissolving a teaspoonful of boric acid powder
in a pint of water);</p>

<p>4. Thiersch&#8217;s solution (prepared by dissolving 15
grains of salicylic acid and 90 grains of
boric acid in a pint of water);</p>

<p>5. Burow&#8217;s solution (a solution of aluminium
acetate prepared by dissolving 675 grains of
alum and 270 grains of lead acetate in a pint
of water.U.S.P. formula);</p>

<p>6. solution of bichloride of mercury (varying in

<p>Put the chlorinated lime in a 12 litre flask with 5
litres of ordinary water and let stand over night.
Dissolve the sodium carbonate and bicarbonate in
5 litres of cold water; then pour this into the flask
and shake it vigorously for a minute and let it
stand to permit the calcium carbonate to settle.
After half an hour, siphon off the clear liquid
and filter it to obtain a perfectly limpid
product. The antiseptic solution is then ready for
surgical use: it contains about 0.5 gm. per cent.
of sodium hypochlorite with small amounts of
neutral salts. It is practically isotonic with blood
serum. Never heat the solution, and always keep it
from the light. If in an emergency it is necessary
to triturate the chlorinated lime in a mortar, do so
only with water, never with the solution of the
soda salts.</p>

<p>This solution has been used extensively abroad
in the treatment of infections and wounds and has
given splendid results.</p>

<p>(A proper quantity of Dakin&#8217;s solution for
office purposes would be about one-tenth of the
prescription above given.)</p>

<h4><b>DUSTING POWDERS</b></h4>

<p>These are employed either as antiseptics or as astringents
or for both purposes. Their use is limited, and they
are employed only where the secretion is scanty.</p>

<p>Among the various powders used are: aristol, dermatol,
boric acid, orthoform, calomel, protonuclein, zinc oxide, alum,
scarlet red, etc.</p>

<p><i>Thymoliodide</i>, or <i>aristol</i>, is a splendid antiseptic powder
and enjoys the advantage over iodoform of being inodorous.</p>

<p><i>Iodoform</i> should only be used in tubercular conditions.</p>

<p><i>Dermatol</i>, or <i>bismuth subgallate</i>, combines the astringent
and mildly antiseptic qualities of bismuth and gallic
acid.</p>

<p><i>Boric acid</i> is mildly antiseptic.</p>

<p><i>Calomel</i> should only be used in syphilitic conditions.</p>

<p><i>Zinc oxide</i> and <i>alum</i> are both astringent.</p>

<p>Scarlet red (5 per cent.) with boric acid (95 per cent.)
is indicated for the stimulation of granulations.</p>

<p><b>Solutions.</b> Among the various solutions used are silver
nitrate, in various strengths, zinc and copper sulphate,
ichthyol, balsam of Peru, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, trichlorand
monochloracetic acid.</p>

<p><i>Silver nitrate</i> is employed for its astringent action, as
are also the <i>copper</i> and <i>zinc sulphates</i>.</p>

<p>Balsam of Peru is used for its stimulating action.</p>

<p>The stronger acids are employed for their escharotic
qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Red wash&#8221; (made up from the following formula:
zinc sulphate 20 grains, compound tincture of lavender 30
minims, distilled water to make 8 ozs.) has a powerful
astringent action and promotes cicatrization, especially when
there is a tendency for the granulations to become exuberant.</p>

<p>In the treatment of chilblains, a strong astringent is
desirable to constrict the diluted capillaries.</p>

<p>The stronger <i>lotio alba</i> of the national formulary, containing
equal parts of the saturated solutions of zinc sulphate
and potassium sulphuret, is markedly astringent and
has a drying effect upon the skin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<h4><b>STYPTICS</b></h4>

<p><b>Styptics.</b> These may act either by causing clot formation
in the cut arteries, or by causing the retraction of their
edges. In the latter class are included such drugs as
<i>hydrastine</i> and <i>adrenaline</i>.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of using these drugs lies in the fact
that secondary hemorrhage is possible when their constrictor
action is over. The styptics causing clot formation are
therefore to be recommended. They should be non-irritating,
antiseptic, and styptic, at the same time. Such a
preparation is practically unknown.</p>

<p><i>Peroxide of hydrogen</i> on a pledget of cotton, placed over
the bleeding area, may effect a clot formation.</p>

<p>The U.S.P. <i>liquor ferri subsulphatis</i>, better known as
Monsel&#8217;s solution, is the best and most effective styptic that
we have. Monsel&#8217;s solution, however, is not antiseptic and
entrance of bacteria into the wound is possible, unless, it is
applied with a sterile applicator or is dropped directly upon
the wound from the bottle.</p>

<p>The U.S.P. <i>tincture of iodine</i> in equal parts of water,
applied to the bleeding area may, besides sterilizing it, stop
bleeding.</p>

<p>Should none of the above effect a stoppage of the bleeding,
other means must be sought. A bit of sterile gauze
pressed quite firmly against the area, should next be tried.
If this fails, a wooden applicator, prepared with Monsel&#8217;s
solution may be employed. A cotton wound applicator,
unless dipped into a strongly antiseptic solution, contains
millions of bacteria from the fingers. The use of the ancient
styptic stick of alum, copper or silver is discountenanced
everywhere as uncleanly.</p>

<h3><b>SOLVENTS</b></h3>

<p><b>Solvents.</b> Under this heading, those substances which
are known to soften tissue will be considered.</p>

<p><i>Sodium hydroxide</i>, up to a saturated strength, or an
ointment of <i>salicylic acid</i>, 5 per cent. to 50 per cent., depending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
upon the density of the tissue to which it is applied,
are the ones commonly used.</p>

<p>These two drugs have the power to macerate dry, hard
tissues.</p>

<p>Experience is necessary for the proper use of tissue
solvents as the length of time that they are allowed to act
is of as much importance as the strength of the solution.</p>

<p>Sodium hydroxide solution can be instantly neutralized
with any acid and for this reason is preferable.</p>

<h3><b>OINTMENTS</b></h3>

<p><b>Ointments.</b> In the list of ointments, the much vaunted
virtues of advertised compounds are usually found.</p>

<p>Ointments and oils are used in the treatment of wounds
and ulcers, either to stimulate granulations or to soften
thick epidermis.</p>

<p>Ointments should never be used where there is a profuse
discharge, as eczema is a complication which very often
follows such treatment.</p>

<p>A great many different kinds of ointments are used
and among these are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sulphur</i> in 10 per cent. strength, or <i>ammoniated
mercury</i> up to 5 per cent., where a paraciticide is
indicated.</p>

<p><i>Balsam of Peru</i> in 10 per cent. strength for the
stimulation of granulations; or <i>balsam of Peru</i>
and <i>castor oil</i>, equal parts; also <i>boric acid</i>, or
<i>ichthyol</i> for their antiseptic properties.</p>

<p>Ten per cent. <i>mercurial</i>, for syphilitic cases.</p>

<p><i>Lassar&#8217;s paste</i> (which consists of salicylic acid,
one dram, starch and zinc oxide, each one ounce,
and vaselin to make 4 ounces) is used when
there is an eczema present.</p></div>

<p>One of the oldest as well as one of the best applications
is balsam of Peru, which has a powerful effect in increasing
the growth of granulations, but often after this has occurred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the granulations are apt to become exuberant with little
tendency to cicatrization.</p>

<p>The ointment which has given the best results is <i>scarlet
red</i>, an aniline dye, which is known chemically as a sodium
salt of a disulphonic acid derivative. Scarlet red (Biebrich)
was originally prepared as a dye for wool and silk, and is
so named because of the fact that it was first manufactured
in the town of Biebrich. It was first used for medicinal
purposes in 1907 in an 8 per cent. strength; because this
strength was found to be too irritating, it was alternated
with a bland ointment every 24 hours. It is now used
only in strengths varying from one-half to five per cent.,
for the latter has proved to be as strong as necessary. When
applied to granulating surfaces, scarlet red is sometimes
absorbed in sufficient amount to color the urine a bright red,
and a number of acute cases of nephritis have been reported
from its use.</p>

<p>Its application to granulating surfaces causes healing,
not by the formation of scar tissue, but in every case by
producing a high grade of normal skin (this can be demonstrated
by sections), which very soon becomes freely movable
on the underlying tissue. The return of sensation in
the healed area takes place from the periphery inward, instead
of upward from the underlying tissue.</p>

<p>Scarlet red ointment should be applied in the following
manner: after thorough cleansing of the part with tincture
of green soap and water, then ether and finally 93 per cent.
alcohol, the ointment should be spread in a thin layer over
the entire surface on a piece of sterile gauze, and over this
an ordinary dry sterile dressing. If the ointment is applied
too thickly it may cause granulation tissue to break
down, and for this reason it should be spread in a thin
layer upon the granulating surface or its edges. Usually
the dressing should be left undisturbed for from 24 to 48
hours, then reapplied, as indications warrant. The patient
should invariably be informed that the dressing will be
stained red, so as to forestall unnecessary alarm, due
to the belief that a hemorrhage has occurred. He should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
also be apprised of the fact that stains on the linen are hard
to eradicate. In removing the dressing, if it is adherent to
the granulations, some peroxide of hydrogen should be used
to loosen it. The skin about the granulating surface is best
cleansed by benzine as this removes all traces of scarlet red
better than any other solution. The three formulas that
are recommended are the following:</p>

<table style="font-size: .9em;" summary="three formulas">

<p>The first is indicated where its use is desired over a
large area and for a long time; the second, where an astringent
action is required because the granulations are
profuse; the third, where the granulations are sluggish and
require stimulation.</p>

<p>The ointment in a 10 per cent. strength is not recommended
because it is too irritating.</p>

<p>In cases of chronic leg ulcers, especially those associated
with enlarged veins, it is impossible to effect a cure
until the chronic congestion of the limb is relieved and the
blood supply of the part approaches the normal.</p>

<p>Often all that is necessary is a gauze, muslin or flannel
bandage, properly applied over the dressing and extending
from the ankle to the knee.</p>

<p>A rubber bandage when applied with moderate, even
pressure, has for its purpose the relief of congestion, but in
a great many cases the rubber has an irritating effect on
the skin.</p>

<p>When the granulations are almost on a level with the
surrounding skin, and also when there is considerable thickening
of the edges of the ulcer, the best means of keeping
up an even pressure and causing absorption of the thickened
margins, as well as of hastening the epithelial growth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
is to apply zinc oxide adhesive plaster in strips, one-half
to one inch in width. These strips should overlap to the
extent of about one-third of their width; should extend about
three-fourths of the way around the limb, and should be
evenly and smoothly applied. They should be started about
one inch below the ulcer and should run from two to three
inches above it.</p>

<h3><b>BANDAGING</b></h3>

<p><b>Bandaging of Leg.</b> The final stage after the dressing
has been put on, consists in the application of the bandage.
A bandage possesses advantages over strapping in being
less irritating to the skin; in being more quickly put on and
taken off; in being more easily removed without disturbing
the surface, and in more completely allowing the formation
of the granulations.</p>

<p>The bandage is also superior to a laced stocking, as the
latter does not properly embrace the foot.</p>

<p>The bandage material can be either gauze, muslin or
flannel. The last is considered the best because this material
is thin, yielding and elastic and yet almost any degree
of compression can be exercised with it.</p>

<p>In edematous swelling in general, the flannel appears
very suitable, as it is soft to the skin and accommodates
itself to the greater or less distension of the limb, arising
from the increase or diminution of the fluid. The bandage
should be at least six yards long, if required for an ordinary
adult, and the width should be from two to three inches.
Every portion of the limb, from the toes to the knees, should
be equally and evenly compressed. Compression is of such
absolute importance that without it everything else will be
comparatively ineffectual. This being so, very much will
depend on the manner in which the bandage is employed.</p>

<p>Without practice, it is not easy to properly apply a
bandage to the leg, and probably this difficulty is the chief
reason why preference is often given to adhesive plaster,
as this sticks wherever it is put.</p>

<p>The blistering and excoriation often produced by strapping,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and the time consumed in its application, are sufficient
reasons for acquiring skill in the art of bandaging; an art
whose comforts and advantages are appreciated by the
patient.</p>

<p>Before using, the bandage should be rolled up very
tightly, so that it may be grasped easily and held in the
hand firmly without slipping. In putting it on, unwind only
that portion which is being applied to the limb, because if
it be loose in the hand, or if a considerable piece be unrolled
at a time, it cannot be applied firmly or smoothly.
The bandage should always be carried up to the knee, even
if the ulcer or wound be seated on the lower part of the
leg or on the foot itself, as the object of its application is
not merely to cover the ulcer but also to support the vessels
of the limb. If the bandage be discontinued on any
part of the leg, it is liable to become loose and fall down.</p>

<p>It is desirable also that the patient should not wear a
garter above the bandage, as anything unequally tight in
the course of the veins is calculated to obstruct the free
passage of the blood.</p>

<p>The firmness with which the bandage is put on is, of
course, chiefly for the purpose of gaining the good effects
of compression on the structures beneath, but besides, it
contributes very much in making the bandage remain in its
position when applied. Encircle the limb with it in a loose,
careless manner, and it will fall down almost immediately
the patient begins to walk about. Tight bandaging is extremely
well borne if performed in a complete and methodical
way, beginning at the lowest portion of the foot around
the first joints of the toes and ending just below the knee.</p>

<p>The proper application of the bandage is of such great
importance, especially in the treatment of varicose ulcers of
the leg, that it should, when possible, always be done by the
doctor himself. It is difficult for the most skilled layman
to put a bandage on his own leg. The real practical difficulty
lies with those patients who live at a distance from
the doctor and who can only visit him once a week or at ten
day intervals. These must be taught to dress and bandage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the limb, and generally some friend or relative will learn
to superintend the details.</p>

<p>The length of time which elapses before the bandage
and dressings are removed and reapplied must necessarily
be determined by the circumstances of each case. When the
ulcer is very extensive and the discharge proportionately
great, it may be advisable to dress the leg every day at the
beginning of the treatment. Generally speaking, an ulcer
of the leg is disturbed too often. To take off a dressing and
put on another, even though done with the greatest care,
interrupts the healing process and the natural steps to cure.
Let the dressing remain on until some uneasiness points
to the propriety of taking it off, for the purpose of allowing
the escape of the discharge. Delay the removal of the
dressings as long as possible without carrying the forbearance
too far. Avoid extremes of waiting too long or of
meddling too soon. Taking the average case, an interval
of three days may in general be safely permitted.</p>

<p><b>Spiral Bandage of the Great Toe.</b> In applying this
bandage, the initial extremity of the roller is secured by
two or three turns around the ankle and the bandage is carried
obliquely across the dorsum of the foot to the base of
the toe to be covered, and next to its tip, by oblique turns;
a circular turn is then made and the toe is covered by
ascending spiral or spiral reverse turns until its base is
reached, from which point the bandage is carried obliquely
across the dorsum of the foot and finished by one or two
circular turns around the ankle. The end of the bandage
may be secured by a pin or may be split into two tails and
secured by tying.</p>

<p><b>Spica Bandage of Great Toe.</b> This bandage is applied
by placing the initial extremity of the roller upon the ankle
and fixing it by two circular turns; the roller is then carried
obliquely over the dorsal surface of the foot to the
distal extremity of the great toe; a circular turn is next
made and the bandage is carried upward over the back of
the great toe to the ankle, around which a circular turn
should be made; ascending figure of eight turns are then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
made around the great toe and the ankle, each turn overlapping
the previous one, two-thirds, and each figure of
eight turn alternating with a circular turn around the ankle.
These turns are repeated until the great toe is completely
covered with spica turns and the bandage is completed by
circular turns around the ankle.</p>

<p><b>French Bandage of the Foot.</b> In applying this bandage
the initial extremity of the roller should be fixed on the
leg just above the ankle and secured by two circular turns
around the leg; the bandage should be carried obliquely
across the dorsum of the foot, to the metatarsophalangeal
articulation, at which point a circular turn should be made
around the foot; the roller should then be carried up to the
foot, covering it with two or three spiral reverse turns;
after this a figure of eight turn should be made around the
ankle and instep; this should be repeated once to cover the
foot, with the exception of the heel, and the bandage continued
up the leg with spiral reverse turns.</p>

<p><b>Spica Bandage of the Foot.</b> In applying this bandage,
the initial extremity of the roller should be fixed just above
the ankle and secured by two circular turns; the bandage
should then be carried obliquely over the dorsum of the
foot to the metatarsophalangeal articulation; a circular turn
around the foot should be made at this point and the bandage
continued upward over the metatarsus by making two
or three spiral reverse turns; it should then be carried parallel
with the inner or the outer margin of the sole of the
foot, according as it is applied to the right or left foot, directly
across the posterior surface of the heel, and from
this point it should be conducted around the outer border
of the toe and over the dorsum, crossing the original turn
in the median line of the foot, thus completing the first spica
turn. These spica turns should be repeated, gradually
ascending, by allowing each turn to cover three-fourths of
the preceding one, until the foot is covered, with the exception
of the posterior portion of the sole of the heel; the
turns should cross one another in the medium line of the
foot and should be kept parallel throughout their course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<b>Bandages for the Foot and Leg.</b> Whenever possible
the patient should be kept in bed, or, at least, in the recumbent
position with the leg elevated, but when circumstances
do not permit of this the veins can be supported in various
ways. Elastic stockings are excellent but expensive, and
not durable. Bandages of rubber cloth, or woven bandages
rendered elastic by the character of the mesh, or Martin&#8217;s
plain rubber bandage may be employed. The last named
is put on smoothly but not too tightly, for in walking the
leg swells, so that a uniform pressure is established. As
the rubber prevents evaporation it acts like a wet compress,
stimulating the granulations, but very often producing
eczema around the ulcer. The rubber bandage should
be washed carefully at night with soap and cold water and
must be kept clean. In one patient a firm elastic stocking
of vulcanized rubber will give the greatest ease and comfort,
while in another the resulting irritation will prove
unbearable. As regards the flannel bandage it has already
been described at some length.</p>

<p>The essential feature of ambulatory treatment is a
good dressing to prevent congestion, and Unna&#8217;s paste is
ideal for this purpose. The paste necessary for the bandage
is prepared as follows: first dissolve four parts of the best
gelatin in ten parts of water by means of a hot water bath.
While the fluid is hot add ten parts of glycerine and four
parts of powdered white oxide of zinc; stir briskly until the
mixture is cold. Another formula for the paste, and the
one recommended, consists of the following: white gelatin,
2-1/2 ounces; water, 8 ounces; zinc oxide, 2-1/2 ounces, and
glycerine, 4 ounces; prepared as above. The paste should
always be melted before use by placing the receptacle in a
hot water bath or in an ordinary copper sterilizer, such as
that employed for boiling instruments. A small tin can be
used, and a piece of paste about four inches square is cut
into fine pieces and put in the can. This is placed in the
sterilizer, into which is poured water to a depth of about
two inches, so that the can is but slightly immersed. No
top should be placed on the can. An ordinary stove or gas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
range can be used for heating purposes. A very important
fact to remember is that no water is to be put into the
can with the paste.</p>

<p>The leg is next cleansed, and after the paste has been
thoroughly melted it is applied from the base of the toes
to the knee, as hot as the patient can comfortably tolerate
it, by means of an ordinary small paint-brush. Then a layer
of gauze bandage (two to three inches in width, according
to the limb) is applied, then a layer of paste, and in this
manner two or three thicknesses of bandage are used, depending
on the case. In thin people, it is necessary to use
only one or two layers of bandage, whereas in stout persons
several layers may be required. After the last application
of the paste, some non-absorbent cotton is spread
on the bandage, giving it the so-called &#8220;moleskin&#8221; plaster
finish. Another way of finishing the dressing is to dust
some ordinary talcum powder on the last layer of the paste,
giving the bandage the appearance of a plaster-of-Paris
dressing. If there is an ulcer, a window can be cut out, thus
providing for the drainage of the secretions. The length
of time this dressing should be left on depends on a number
of conditions, especially the amount of secretion, and
whether the patient has to remain on his feet very much.
Ordinarily, the bandage can remain on for one week, but
indications may be such that it need not be removed sooner
than the tenth day, and in some instances it can be kept on
for three or four weeks. To remove it, an ordinary bandage-scissors
is used to cut the dressing, and it peels off without
disturbing any of the granulations on the ulcer.</p>

<h3><b>PROMOTION OF NEW EPITHELIAL GROWTH AND
CICATRIZATION</b></h3>

<p>The value of nitrate of silver and red wash as stimulants
of the healing process has already been mentioned.
They are also of value in producing cicatrization and in
promoting the covering of new epithelium over the ulcer
or wound. If the solid stick of nitrate of silver be applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
very lightly to the edges just inside the pale bluish line of
advancing epithelium, so as to produce a white film on the
surface, this slight cauterization will be found to aid in
strengthening and cornifying the new, delicate and previously
invisible epithelial cells and in preventing them from
being washed away by the discharge from the ulcer. The
solid stick of nitrate of silver is also of benefit in destroying
the exuberant granulations which project above the surface
of the surrounding skin; often, by piercing these flabby
granulations in several places with the solid stick held perpendicular
to the surface, cicatrization is hastened. After
the granulations are level with the surrounding skin the
covering of the ulcer or wound with new epithelium is
hastened by the application of some smooth surface along
which the epithelium can spread. For this purpose zinc
oxide plaster or some thin rubber may be used.</p>

<p>In some old chronic cases, healing is prevented by the
fact that the base of the ulcer cannot contract owing to
its being bound down by fibrous scar tissue. This binding
down of the base and edges of the ulcer also tends to cut
off the blood supply, and therefore in this additional manner
healing is hindered. For the relief of this condition a
number of procedures have been devised. Mattress sutures,
introduced through the normal skin beyond the edges of
the ulcer and passing beneath it, out through the skin on
the other side, is one method. By tightening these sutures,
over a button or metal plate, the ulcer can be lifted from
the underlying tissues. Another method, called &#8220;starring
of the ulcer,&#8221; consists in a series of radiating incisions
through the base and edges of the ulcer, the part from which
the incisions radiate corresponding with its centre. In
this and in the following operations, in order to obtain a
favorable result, it is necessary that the incisions pass completely
through the cicatrical tissue which forms the base
and edges of the ulcer into normal tissue. &#8220;Cross-hatching&#8221;
of the base of the ulcer by means of a series of incisions
at right angles to one another, and at a distance of
about one-half inch apart, is often of value in aiding the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
healing of a chronic ulcer, the continued existence of which
and failure to heal having been due to its thickened, adherent
base and edges. Circumcision of a chronic ulcer
consists in making a circular incision around it through the
normal skin. A modification of this method consists in
making a series of overlapping, short, curved incisions surrounding
the ulcer, instead of a single circular incision.
In these last two methods it is necessary that the incisions
be made through normal skin, and that the wounds be made
to gape, if necessary, by packing them with gauze.</p>

<p>When the ulcer or wound is of considerable size, it is
often impossible to secure healing even by these methods.
It may for a time appear as if it were going to heal, and a
pale blue line of newly formed epithelium may spread out
from the edges, but instead of the epithelium continuing
its progress, at a subsequent dressing it will be found to
have disappeared. In these cases, as well as in those in
which the size of the ulcer would necessitate a long delay
for a cure or in which the subsequent contraction of the
scar would produce deformity, skin grafting, skin transplantation,
or some form of flap operation is indicated.</p>

<h3><b>SKIN GRAFTING TO OBTAIN A SOUND SCAR</b></h3>

<p>A very important object in the treatment of all ulcers
is to obtain a sound scar. In ulcers affecting the lower extremity
in elderly people, the scar resulting from spontaneous
healing is weak and readily breaks down if the patient
does much standing or walking. The patient is therefore
frequently obliged to give up work in order to get the ulcer
re-healed, or must be content to employ means which merely
prevent its extension and relieve some of the discomfort.
When the best possible scar is desired, and when it is important
to avoid marked contraction, it is necessary to
adopt some method of skin-grafting.</p>

<p>There are three plans by which rapid healing of an
ulcer may be brought about: Reverdin&#8217;s epidermis grafting;
Thiersch&#8217;s skin grafting, and the use of the whole
thickness of the skin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reverdin&#8217;s Method.</b> In this procedure small thin portions
of the superficial layer of the skin are snipped off with
a curved scissors. Pieces about the size of a hemp seed are
planted on the surface of the granulations at short distances
from one another. Epidermic growth occurs from
each of these little points, and the result is that numerous
small islands of epithelium form over the surface of the
ulcer. If the grafts be close enough together and the conditions
be favorable to healing, these islands soon coalesce
and thus rapid cicatrization is obtained. The grafts should
not be too far apart, because they appear to have only a
limited power of reproduction.</p>

<p><b>With a view to obtaining a sounder scar</b>, thicker and
more extensive portions of the skin must be taken and the
grafts must be applied close together. There are two ways
of doing this: either by using the whole thickness of the
skin or by employing Thiersch&#8217;s method, in which about
half the thickness of the skin is shaved off.</p>

<p>The procedure where the whole thickness of the skin is
employed need not be described, partly because the results
are not satisfactory and partly because all the conditions
for which it was introduced are better fulfilled by Thiersch&#8217;s
method.</p>

<p>Skin grafts may be taken either from the patient himself
or from another individual. When the patient is much
debilitated, the cutaneous epithelium shares in the general
malnutrition and under these circumstances a graft from
a healthy subject might succeed better than one taken from
the patient.</p>

<p><b>Thiersch&#8217;s Method.</b> In employing this method the skin
which is to be used for the grafting must first be shaved
and disinfected in the usual manner, as has been previously
described. The presence of hairs on the grafts seems to
interfere materially with their union.</p>

<p><b>Preparation of the Ulcer.</b> <i>Preliminary.</i> It is of no use
to graft a sore which is actually ulcerating; it must be
brought into a healthy condition, and healing must have
commenced before transplantation is likely to be successful.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
The best criterion that healing is taking place is the presence,
at the edges, of the dry line which indicates recently
formed epithelium. Some surgeons wait for a considerably
longer time before grafting in order to get a firm layer of
granulations, but experience shows that it may be safely
resorted to as soon as healing begins around the edge. A
second essential is that the ulcer shall be clean. If the
discharges be septic, the graft, which is, after all, merely
a piece of dying tissue, will become impregnated with decomposing
pus and may rapidly become loosened, die, and
undergo decomposition. The methods of rendering the ulcer
aseptic have already been described.</p>

<p><i>Operative.</i> The following is the method of procedure:
after the patient has been placed under an anesthetic, the
granulations over the whole surface of the ulcer are forcibly
scrubbed off with a firm nail-brush, or are evenly scraped
away, taking care, however, to remove only the soft layer of
granulations and not to go through the deeper one of newly
formed fibrous tissue into the fat. A surface is thus left
which is smooth, highly vascular, and firm, and which consists
of the deeper layers of granulation tissue that have
already become organized into fibrous tissue. In cases of
ulcer of the leg it is also advisable to remove those portions
of the edge which have already become covered with new
epithelium. If the transplantation be limited to the parts
actually unhealed, the result is disappointing as a rule, for
while the part grafted remains sound, the margin where
spontaneous healing had occurred, is apt to break down,
and thus a narrow line of ulceration appears at the edge of
the ulcer.</p>

<p>After the layer of granulations has been removed and
the newly healed edge of the ulcer has been cut away, the
bleeding must be arrested completely before the grafts are
applied. The most rapid method is to pour a few drops of
adrenalin chloride (1 to 1000) solution over the raw surface,
when the oozing ceases immediately. If adrenalin be
not at hand the following plan will be found satisfactory:
any spouting vessel is clamped and a large piece of sterilized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
gauze or thin sheet rubber is applied over the raw
surface of the wound; outside this, several sponges are
placed and a sterilized bandage is bound firmly over them.
If the sore be small and an assistant be available, he may
apply the pressure. Pressure is employed indirectly
through the protective in this way, because if it were made
directly upon the surface of the wound by means of the
sponges, bleeding would recommence when the latter were
removed, as they stick to the raw surface.</p>

<p>While the bleeding is being arrested the surgeon cuts
his skin grafts from any part of the body, as he thinks fit
As a rule they are taken from the front of the thigh, but
the side of the abdomen may be selected. The area from
which the grafts are to be cut is disinfected, and the surgeon
grasps the limb from behind with his left hand in
such a way as to make the skin over the front of the thigh
as tense as possible; in doing this he pushes the soft parts
well forward so as to make the anterior aspect of the limb
as flat as possible. The skin is further put on the stretch
vertically by an assistant, who pulls it upward and downward.
These precautions are important, as without them
it is almost impossible to cut a graft of even width. The
razor, which should have a very broad blade, is dipped into
a boric acid solution and is kept constantly wet with it
whilst the grafts are being cut. Unless this be done, the
graft adheres to the blade and may be either partially or
wholly cut through before a sufficient length can be obtained.
The razor is made to penetrate through about half
the thickness of the skin, and then, by a lateral sawing
motion, the grafts are cut as broad and as long as possible.
After a little practice it is easy to cut them about two
inches in breadth and about four or five inches in length.</p>

<p>If one graft be insufficient, it is best to slide it off the
razor and leave it on the bleeding surface; in this way it is
kept warm and moist. Some surgeons put the graft into
warm saline solution, and it is said to then spread out more
easily afterwards. Small skin grafts can be cut under local
anesthesia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Application of Grafts.</b> When a sufficient number of
grafts have been cut, the bandage, sponges and protective
are removed from the raw surface of the ulcer and the
grafts are applied to it if the bleeding has stopped, as is
generally the case. The raw surface usually has a thin
layer of blood-clot upon it, and this should be wiped away.</p>

<p>Each graft is lifted with forceps or the fingers and applied
with the cut surface downward, and then is carefully
unfolded by means of two probes and stretched evenly over
the surface. The grafts should overlap the edges of the
skin and also each other, so that no part of the raw surface
is left exposed, for granulations always spring up on the
uncovered parts and are apt to destroy the grafts in their
vicinity; moreover, a thin scar is left at these points which
may break down subsequently. The graft is always thinner
at its edges than at its centre, and it is these thin edges
which overlap each other or the margin of the skin; there
is no real sloughing of these overlapping portions.</p>

<p>The dressing should be left on the grafted surface for
about five days; in some cases even for a week. If the
wound be aseptic, no suppuration or decomposition takes
place beneath it. Before being removed, the dressing should
be thoroughly soaked with a 1 in 2500 sublimate solution, for
otherwise it may stick at the edge and adhere to the graft,
which may thus be peeled off, unless great care is taken.
The parts should be gently cleansed with the same solution,
and a dressing similar to that put on originally should be
employed for about another week. At the end of that time
the grafts are fairly, firmly adherent and then a 5 per
cent, boric acid ointment is the best application.</p>

<p>It will be found that even at the first dressings the
grafts present a pink color and are adherent to the deeper
surface, though they are still readily detachable. In the
course of about a week the old cuticle peels off, but no raw
surface is left. Later on, there is a great tendency to the
formation of new epithelium, cornification, and drying-up,
and it is to avoid the latter condition that ointments are so
useful; in fact, until the scar is absolutely sound, it is well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to keep the surface covered with some greasy application,
the best being the 5 per cent, boric acid ointment.</p>

<p>For many months the grafted surface is likely to scale
or crack, and this might prove a starting-point for the
occurrence of sepsis which would cause the newly grafted
area to slough. It is important to keep the scar as supple
as possible, and therefore it should be constantly anointed
with cold cream, vaselin, or lanolin. Grafted surfaces upon
the face, however, do not manifest this tendency for any
length of time.</p>

<p><b>Time Required for Cure.</b> It is important to know when
the patient may be allowed to walk about after an ulcer of
the leg has been skin-grafted. If he begins too soon, the
grafts will almost certainly become detached. That this will
be so is evident from a consideration of the mode by which
the adhesion of the grafts takes place. At first they adhere
to the surface of the sore, simply by means of the effused
and coagulated length. Cells rapidly spread into this length
and in the course of two or three days the space between
the grafts and the raw surfaces is occupied by a mass of
young cells. In this tissue, new blood vessels develop and
penetrate into the graft, whilst, at the same time, the cells
of the latter grow and assist in the development of the
young tissue and of the blood vessels. Thus the graft becomes
vascularized; but for a considerable time the tissue
between it and the surface of the sore contains many young
blood vessels with delicate walls, and therefore, if the patient
stands erect and allows the pressure of the column of blood
to fall on these vessels, they rupture, and bleeding occurs
beneath the graft and leads to its detachment.</p>

<p>It requires a long time before the graft is firmly incorporated
with the tissue beneath by the development of
elastic fibres; indeed, it may be reckoned that this union is
not complete until from three to six months have elapsed.
The graft will, in all probability, be destroyed if the patient
walks about within three months of the transplantation.
Hence, unless that time can be devoted to the treatment, it
is not worth employing skin-grafting for ulcer of the lower
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
limbs. By this, however, it is not implied that it is necessary
to keep the patient in bed for the entire time, but merely
that the foot must not be allowed to hang down, nor must
any weight be borne upon it.</p>

<p>At the end of about six weeks the patient may be allowed
to get up and lie on a sofa or sit with the leg on
another chair, but the limb must not be permitted to hang
down. After about three months he may be allowed to get
about, but in order to prevent the detachment of the grafts,
he should be fitted with a knee-rest and peg on which he
walks, the leg projecting out behind him. If possible he
should not put his foot to the ground until six months have
elapsed. In cases of sores on other parts of the body, when
the erect posture does not cause congestion of the part, the
patient may be allowed to walk about after the first three
weeks.</p>

<p><b>Results.</b> The scar which results after skin-grafting performed
in this manner is of a satisfactory character, and
ulcers which have been intractable for years may be closed
satisfactorily by this means. In order to obtain anything
in the nature of a permanent cure, however, the prescribed
period of rest must be adhered to rigidly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3><b>LOCAL ANESTHESIA</b></h3>

<p><b>History.</b> From Corning we learn that the ancient
Assyrians alleviated and even entirely prevented the pain
incident to circumcision by compressing the veins in the
neck. Unconsciousness was probably induced in this way
together with pressure on the carotids.</p>

<p>In India, centuries ago, the effects of opium and of
Indian hemp were known and employed, and the ancient
Egyptians were also conversant with the soporific effects
of many drugs. We learn, from the same authority, much
which he gathered from literature about the history of local
anesthesia, and it is from Corning&#8217;s well-known book on
local anesthesia that most of this history is quoted.</p>

<p>In Peru, the Spanish conquerors learned that the coca
loaf was held in high esteem by the natives, inasmuch as
they observed that it was chewed by the high priests and
nobility only, the vulgar being denied this privilege except
as a reward of great merit or of distinguished valor. The
leaf was regarded with awe and superstition and was supposed
to possess supernatural powers. After the fall of the
Incas, the Spanish not only permitted but encouraged the
general use of the leaf in order to obtain more work from
the natives, a result which the drug seemed to effect. It
was also a source of great revenue to them and was sold at
exorbitant profit to the natives who became enslaved to
its effects but were able to endure great hardship while
under its influence.</p>

<p>Chemists throughout the world, recognizing the potent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
action of the coca leaf, were soon engaged in the effort of
extracting its active principle.</p>

<p>In 1859, after many had tried and failed, cocaine was
evolved from crude extractives. Authorities differ as to
whether it was Mann or Neimann, a pupil of Woehler, who
first presented cocaine to the chemical world; however,
fifteen added years elapsed before practical use for it was
found. In 1862, Professor Schraff discovered that the tip
of the tongue was rendered numb, and insensible when a
little of the cocaine alkaloid was applied to it and that it
remained so for a considerable length of time. Significant
though this experiment was, the action of cocaine on the
nerve-filaments was not recognized and the matter was not
followed up until Dr. Karl Koller, of Vienna, began his
experiments which resulted in a universal awakening to the
use of a substance which, though known, had been allowed
to remain unnoticed for ages.</p>

<p>Its anesthetic effect upon the eye was demonstrated by
Koller at the Opthalmologic Congress at Heidelberg in 1884.
Dr. H. D. Noyes was first to direct the attention of the
American practitioners to Koller&#8217;s results in the use of the
drug. Its introduction was one of the greatest triumphs of
modern surgery. It makes possible the discard of the
systemic anesthetics in all minor surgical operations and also
in many operations of considerable magnitude.</p>

<p>In the laboratory of Professor Stricker, Koller experimented
on the eyes of a number of animals and thus
reports his findings:</p>

<p>&#8220;A few drops of a watery solution of muriate of cocaine
dropped on the cornea of a guinea pig, rabbit, or dog, or
instilled into the conjunctival sac in the ordinary way,
caused, for a short time, a winking of the eyelids, evidently
in consequence of a slight irritation. After one-half to
one minute the animal again opens its eyes which gradually
assume a staring look. If now the cornea is touched with a
pin head (in which experiment we have carefully avoided
touching the eyelashes), the lids are not closed by reflex
and the eyeball does not move, the head is not thrown back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
as usual, the animal remains perfectly quiet, and, on application
of a stronger irritation we can convince ourselves of the
complete anesthesia of the cornea. In this way I have
scratched and transfixed the cornea of the animals used for
experiment with needles, and have excited them with electric
currents so strong as to cause pain in my fingers, and to
become quite intolerable to the tongue. I have cauterized
the cornea with the nitrate of silver stick until it became
milky white; during all of this the animal did not move.
The last experiment convinced me that the anesthesia involved
the whole thickness of the cornea and did not affect
the surface only. But if I incised the cornea, the animals
manifested intense pain, when the aqueous humor escaped
and the iris prolapsed. I have been unable hitherto to decide,
by experiments on animals, whether or not the iris
could be anesthetized by dropping the solution into the
corneal wound, or by prolonged instillations into the conjunctival
sac; for experiments to test the sensibility of non-narcotized
animals are very complicated and difficult and do
not yield unambiguous results. The last question which I
subjected to experimentation on animals, viz., whether or
not the inflamed cornea could be anesthetized by cocaine,
was answered in the affirmative. The cornea in which I had
incited a foreign-body-keratitis, became as insensible as a
healthy one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Complete anesthesia of the cornea from the use of a
two per cent. solution lasts ten minutes on an average.
After such successful experiments on animals I did not
hesitate to use cocaine also to the human eye, trying it
first on myself and on some of my friends, and then on a
great number of other persons, obtaining, without exception,
the result of a perfect anesthesia of the cornea and conjunctiva.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after Dr. Koller&#8217;s report appeared, cocaine was
used for a great many operations upon the eye, and its
application to mucous membranes in general was soon taken
up by practitioners everywhere.</p>

<p>Rectal, vaginal, otologic, rhinologic, oral and urethral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
anesthesia were soon found to be easy of accomplishment
and many operations in these fields were performed under
cocainization. The hypodermic injection of cocaine was
experimented with and reported upon in 1884 by Drs. N.
J. Hepburn, R. J. Hall, and Halsted.</p>

<h4><b>PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS</b></h4>

<p><b>Nerve Pressure; Anemia.</b> That motor and sensory
paralysis followed pressure upon a nerve has been well
known for many years, and this has been utilized in the
effort to produce anesthesia, artifically by applying a rubber
tube or bandage around a finger or extremity, with the hope
that &#8220;ligation anesthesia&#8221; would follow the arrest of circulation.
This, however, has been unsuccessful as all that was
thus accomplished was a slight sensation of numbness with
no arrest of the sense of pain. This method could only be
successfully carried out, were the nerves themselves subjected
to sufficient pressure to injure them. Return to
normal sensibility and motor function could not be expected
for months.</p>

<p><b>Cold.</b> The addition of common salt to ice hastens its
liquefaction and consequently renders the mixture more cold.
This knowledge has been applied in a method of producing
anesthesia of limited areas of the skin. A gauze bag of
the correct shape and size is filled with salt and ice mixed,
and applied to the area to be anesthetized.</p>

<p>This method was used as far back as 1848, by Arnott,
but was soon improved upon by Richet and others who
used ether or rhigolene sprayed on the part to be anesthetized.
It was found that extremely low temperatures could
be obtained in this way, especially if a current of air were
blown across the field of operation to hasten evaporation,
and that a good local insensibility could be brought about
if the circulation of warm blood could be either stopped or
retarded with an Esmarch bandage or tourniquet. The
method of obtaining local anesthesia through the agency of
cold was found to be best accomplished by ethyl chloride and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
this substance is used in preference to any of the others
previously mentioned, at the present time. Some years ago
Dr. Martin W. Ware of New York experimented with both
ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide and he found that the
former was more serviceable in producing local anesthesia.</p>

<p><b>The Sensibility of Various Tissues.</b> Karl G. Lennander,
of Upsala, Sweden, shortly before his death, completed a
chapter on local anesthesia for Keen&#8217;s &#8220;Surgery&#8221; in which
is set forth an elaborate account of the sensibility to heat,
cold, pressure, and pain of the various nerve terminals
throughout the body. In this great work he has given the
world the results of many experiments on living tissues,
experiments investigating the degree and kind of the tissues
sensibilities; thus it is learned that &#8220;all internal organs
receiving their nerve supply only from the sympathethic
nerve and from the vagus, below the branching-off of the
recurrent nerve, have no sensation, and that the abdominal
and pelvic viscera are devoid of nerves to convey the sense
of pain, heat, cold, or pressure.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the same authority we are taught that the parietal
peritoneum is highly sensitive but that the visceral covering
is devoid of all sensibility, enabling the operator much
freedom of manipulation within the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>In a work of this limited size the sensibility of the
various tissues cannot be fully treated but it should be
borne in mind that the integument and the subcutaneous
tissue, fat and muscles as well as the tendons, their sheaths,
the muscles and periosteum and perichondrium covering the
bones and cartilages throughout the body, are all highly
sensitive to pain. It is also equally true that the bone
substance, the bone marrow, and the cartilages are devoid
of any of the four modalities of sensation. Articular surfaces
covered with cartilage have no sensation, neither have
the fibrocartilages any sensation.</p>

<h4><b>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4>

<p><b>Effect of General Anesthesia.</b> Local or regional anesthesia
is obviously the method of choice in all cases in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
it is applicable. Not only is it desirable in the minor surgical
operations and the more important ones upon patients
suffering with a cardiac or nephritic derangement, where a
general anesthetic is positively contraindicated, but in every
instance where it is at all possible, the dangers and annoyances
of general anesthesia should be avoided, and the
regional or local anesthesia should be employed.</p>

<p>Among the advantages, aside from the number of assistants
required and the discomfort immediately following
the administration of a general anesthesia, are the absence
of remote ill effects of the invasion throughout the entire
system of a noxious chemical substance and its direct
deleterious effects on many large organs such as the lungs,
heart, kidneys, and liver, and the assurance, when a proper
drug, dosage, and technic are employed, that death cannot
be ascribed to the anesthetic.</p>

<p>Of remote ills of general anesthesia no estimate can
be made, but that they are legion and of great severity is
established. Deaths from general anesthetics in persons
apparently able to bear them well, are extremely numerous.
It has been estimated that one in fifteen thousand succumbs
from ether anesthesia and this number would probably swell
greatly were it possible to obtain the exact figures. Even
this minimum of danger does not exist in local anesthesia.</p>

<p>An accurate knowledge of the neural anatomy of a
particular region enables the operator to anesthetize large
areas and to operate with entire freedom from the necessity
of observing the appearance and conduct of his patients,
many of whom, notably the alcoholic ones, behave badly,
become cyanotic and breathe intermittently when under the
effects of inhalation anesthetics. The absorption into the
body of the substances employed by inhalation may also
exert a baneful influence by reducing the powers of resistance
upon an economy already lowered by disease, and
also by retarding convalescence.</p>

<p><b>Advantages of Local Anesthesia.</b> In minor or trivial
affairs the elimination of pain is not to be considered
lightly, for every patient, even the strongest, will appreciate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
anything which will expedite a cure and at the same time
will relieve him of suffering. Rather than lose time from
their work or suffer the nausea and dangers of general
anesthesia, these patients often bear for years conditions
which could easily be cured by operations under local anesthesia.
In this class one must first think of hemorrhoids; of
cysts; of fatty tumors; of foreign bodies in the hands and
feet; of verruca and of ingrown nails. These conditions
would be promptly relieved were the element of pain in
surgical interference not to enter as a factor.</p>

<p>With a perfect technic, local anesthesia can also be
employed with entire satisfaction for certain major operations,
where the subject is suitable. Thus, herniotomies are
performed with entire success, especially those cases complicated
by strangulation in which the dangers arising from
fecal vomiting and inspiration pneumonia, are greatly decreased
by omitting the general anesthesia.</p>

<p>In many of the more severe conditions not to be classified
as minor surgery, the surgeon may consider the comfort
of the patient and his own convenience and employ local in
preference to general anesthesia, even tho the patients may
be of the most robust type.</p>

<p>In this group may be mentioned benign tumors at any
visible part of the body, hernias, many scrotal and anal
diseases and some conditions peculiar to the extremities,
such as varicose veins. These conditions lend themselves
kindly to local insensitization.</p>

<p>In certain emergencies where an operation must be
performed immediately, such as tracheotomy, thoracentesis
and strangulated hernia, local insensibility is imperative.
In these operations local anesthesia is also more desirable
because of the ill effects of vomiting, which are thus
eliminated.</p>

<p>Weakness of the patient enters also as a demand for
the exhibition of a local anesthesia in such operations as
resection of a rib for empyema, in which instance the action
of the heart or lungs is embarrassed. Other operations performed
under local anesthesia for the same reason (weakness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of the patient) are the exploratory operation for a
probable inoperable cancer and the palliative operations
such as gastrostomy, enterostomy and colostomy.</p>

<h4><b>SOME VALID OBJECTIONS TO THE USE OF
LOCAL ANESTHESIA</b></h4>

<p>There are, however, valid objections to the general
application of local anesthesia and the cases for its use
should be selected with care. It does not produce relaxation
nor does it give the surgeon perfect control over his patient.
These are considerations which must be taken into account,
especially in operating on patients of highly nervous temperaments.
Though the patient may be convinced that he
will suffer no pain, the mental attitude toward the local
anesthesia, together with fear, may operate so strongly as
to constitute a shock to the nervous system so great that a
general anesthetic should be used and the local method
abandoned, even were it apparently indicated.</p>

<p>Again, the injection of anesthetic drugs in cicatrical and
inflamed tissues is quite difficult of accomplishment and because
of the peculiarity of these tissues, diffusion throughout
a given area is imperfect, hence insensibility is not
complete.</p>

<p>The extravagant claims of enthusiastic advocates of
this method of anesthesia have retarded its progress. Thus,
in the hands of the competent operator it was given but a
perfunctory trial to be discarded as impossible. At the
present time, however, local anesthesia bids fair to become
the method of choice, other things being equal, for many
major operations not yet thus performed. Recent investigations
alone these lines have developed methods of its application
whereby it is possible to render insensible large areas
of the integument, and regional anesthesia is performed
by anesthetizing nerves proximal to the seat of operation,
thus rendering amputations feasible.</p>

<p>A single element which has entered as a factor in retarding
the progress of local anesthesia in general surgery,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
is that of regarding the operation as one fitted to the method
rather than to the patient under consideration. It is obvious
that this is a fallacy and the main issue in deciding between
general and local anesthesia is: what will the patient best
tolerate? In coming to a decision in the matter one should
make a general survey and weigh first the general health
of the patient; whether he be in perfect systemic condition
or undermined by disease, whether the shock will be greater
from one method than the other, and whether the part of
the body to be operated on is one which will lend itself
better to one method than to the other.</p>

<p>These elements are being and will continue to be considered
as preliminary to operative procedure and in consequence,
general anesthesia will cease to be given in a
routine way.</p>

<h4><b>GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND ESSENTIALS</b></h4>

<p>The first essential to the successful production of local
anesthesia is a proper equipment and one that is in good
working order. Not only is it necessary to employ the best
drug to this end but also to use a syringe having perfect
mechanical construction and one not injured by boiling; as
also needles of the length, lumen and shape suitable for the
surface to be injected.</p>

<p>The old leather pocket syringes, on account of their
not bearing water at high temperature without deterioration,
should not be employed; this applies also to that variety of
glass barreled metal-mounted syringe in which the glass is
screwed into the metal end pieces.</p>

<p>The best syringes are those made of all metal or of all
glass, the latter being preferred because one may see the
contents and express out the air before injecting. Syringes
of this type, because of the accurate fitting piston, must be
thoroughly dried out after use, as the piston may stick fast
within the barrel. All-glass or all-metal syringes must be
selected with care as they are often imperfect, the calibre of
the barrel being unequal in different parts of its length
causing the piston to fit tightly in some parts, and thus to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
work with difficulty; and in other parts fitting loosely,
allowing the fluid to escape backwards.</p>

<p>Syringes are also made in various sizes and shapes to
meet certain requirements. For the edematization of large
areas of loose tissue, where a considerable amount of a weak
solution is intended, the use of a large barreled syringe will
be found to save time and the annoyance of refilling.</p>

<p>For such work a five or ten c.c. syringe would be the
most useful. The ordinary hypodermic syringe is about of
two c.c. capacity (thirty drops), and serves the purposes
of every-day work. It does very well for the amount of an
anesthetic solution employed in opening an abscess or in
the removal of a small cyst or lipoma or papilloma.</p>

<p>A barrel, large in diameter, requires more pressure on
the piston in its operation unless the needle employed is
also correspondingly large. For this reason, if the tissue in
which the solution is to be injected is not loose or cellular,
it will be found better to use a syringe in which the barrel
is long and narrow. Such is the shape of the syringe intended
for the injection of the gums, the peridental membrane,
and also for the periosteum, cartilage or bony cellular
structure. A long instrument is also required for use
in the large cavities of the body such as the mouth, the
vagina, or the rectum. In these localities, an extension
fitting is often required to lengthen the instrument sufficiently
to reach the desired part. It is also possible to
attain this end by using a long needle; this, however, sacrifices
rigidity.</p>

<p>For accomplishing the best results, the needles must
also be selected for the work at hand. For the initial puncture
in sensitive or inflamed tissue, it is proper to use a
needle of the finest lumen so as to cause the least possible
amount of pain. The ordinary needle, which comes with
the usual hypodermic outfit, is about the proper length for
the ordinary work already mentioned, but could be improved
upon for anesthesia by being made a little finer in calibre.
This length (three-quarters of an inch) will be frequently
found insufficient to reach the deeper tissues and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
removal of a more or less rounded growth, a longer needle
must be selected at the start. Curved or angular ones are
only needed in dentistry, where strength is also a consideration.
Strength is afforded in those of short length by means
of a reinforcement at the hub. Needles so augmented may
also be of use in operations upon bone or dense structures
in general; the curve, however, is not essential.</p>

<p>The surgeon should be fully conversant with the details
of the operation which he is about to perform. His work
should be definitely in his mind, for in operations under
local anesthesia, there is no justification for a change of
procedure after the beginning of the work. Account should
be taken of the nature of the tissues to be anesthetized, for
it is known that cicatricial tissues and inflammatory areas
do not lend themselves to the action of these drugs. In a
cicatrix, the diffusibility of the solution is impeded, and in
an inflammatory or necrotic tissue, the changes in the
quantity and quality of the fluids present, alter the action
of the anesthetic.</p>

<p>In considering the personal element of the patient one
meets a difficulty which is by no means minor, and full explanation
for the selection of the local anesthetic with many
assurances of the painlessness of the operation are frequently
necessary. This is especially true with one of highly
emotional temperament, and, to allay fear in such a patient
is not always easy.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said regarding the mental state of the
patient who is to receive an anesthetic, whether general or
local, the surgeon must remember that to be calm does not
always lie within the control of his subject, and it will be
found that a hypodermic injection of morphine (gr. one-eighth
to one-quarter) an hour before the start of the
anesthetic, will often render possible the use of the injection
method in a patient with whom it would otherwise have been
impossible. Morphine injections, as suggested, are of advantage
in patients on whom a major operation is contemplated;
they loosen the musculature and diminish the sensations
of parts not anesthetized.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The deliberate and confident manner and word of the
surgeon go a long way in guiding the feelings of his patient,
and a worried or apprehensive surgeon makes for a doubtful
and sensitive patient, ready to cry out at the first prick of
the needle. Therefore it is a part of good general technic
for the surgeon to deport himself in a way conducive to
cheerfulness, and conversation must be guided along these
lines.</p>

<p>There are many who will writhe and groan at sensations
(which they will admit later were not painful) incident
to local anesthesia, such as the grating vibrations of
instrumentation. Such a patient is not well fitted for the
method and it is for the discerning surgeon to recognize
such in advance, that he may operate under the most favorable
circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Preparation of the Patient.</b> Proper evacuation of the
bowels and a stomach free of undigested parts of a previous
meal, are desirable. The subject of an anesthetic should
not be purged or starved as these are weakening processes
and also disturb the tranquility so essential to a perfect
anesthesia. The skin should be prepared so as to accomplish
surgical cleanliness without irritating it so as to retard
healing. It was once thought that soap, water, alcohol,
ether and bichloride were absolutely necessary to this end.
It has, however, been found that iodin, applied in the ten
per cent. tincture to the site of incision, fulfills every requirement.
Where shaving is necessary, it should be done
first. In operations about the anus and scrotum, iodin is
contraindicated because of its irritating properties; it is
painful in these parts and dermatitis is frequently the result
of its use.</p>

<p><b>Instruments.</b> The instruments should be prepared and
ready before the anesthetic is given, regardless of the form
of anesthesia employed. The surgeon&#8217;s hands should be
rendered aseptic, no matter how trivial the procedure before
him, and every precaution should be taken to guard against
infection, which is always possible in any surgical procedure
however insignificant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Technic.</b> Various methods of accomplishing the insensitization
of a part may be employed. Thus, if the skin
alone is to be incised, it alone will require injection and by
careful insertion of the end of the needle it may be kept
just under the epidermis, thus injecting the anesthetic endermatically
in and about the papillae of the papillary layer.</p>

<p><b>Endermic Method.</b> This method is an end-organ
anesthesia, and the solutions employed are strong and
act because of their drug content. It is not in any sense a
pressure anesthesia. The skin should be picked up and
pinched hard for the better insertion of the needle directly
into the skin substance. It is therefore endermic and
the skin is seen to become blanched as the needle advances
delivering its solution on the way. But little of the fluid is
pressed out as the needle advances. When the syringe is
empty or the needle has advanced to the limit of its length,
refill and insert just inside of the last blanched spot and
proceed in a line until the end of the contemplated line of
incision is reached.</p>

<p>Pressing out too much of the solution at one time causes
a burning sensation and should therefore be avoided as the
only pain should be that of the initial prick of the needle.
Care, however, should be taken to inject just sufficient of
the solution to penetrate beyond the zone of operation
laterally, to insure sufficient space for the insertion of
sutures into anesthetized tissues. Only a small quantity of
fluid is necessary in this procedure as it comes in direct
contact with nerve terminals. By touching the injected line
with the needle in several places along its length and inquiring
of the patient if it is felt, we may make sure of the
completeness of the anesthesia before making the incision
which should begin and end inside the anesthetized area.</p>

<p><b>Subdermic Method.</b> An appreciable area of skin and
subcutaneous tissue may be incised by anesthetizing as
previously described, together with depositing the fluid well
under the skin, thus affecting many terminal nerve branches
before they reach their final distribution in the skin, and
widening the anesthetized area considerably.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>This method is applicable to such work as the removal
of small growths, and the deep incision of a carbuncle. Beneath
the skin in the loose connective tissue the fluid is deposited
and causes anesthesia by acting upon the nerves
just before their emergence into the skin. The two methods
may be combined. It is not possible to inject directly into
thin skin or mucous membrane and it is therefore employed
in such operations as circumcision, where the nerve terminals
must be anesthetized by the diffusion of the anesthetic
from its position under the skin. A little time should
be allowed before beginning the operation to permit of the
diffusion of the drug. This applies also to such operations
as that for ingrown toe-nail where the deeper tissues down
to the root of the matrix are involved.</p>

<p><b>Edemitization Method.</b> This is the method of Schleich
and it is to him that the credit must be given for a procedure
which has done more to encourage the use of local
anesthetics in operative surgery than any other. He employed
weak solutions of cocaine and other local anesthetics
in great volumes of water in order to gain the combined
action of both drug and of pressure. The method is described
under the heading of &#8220;Cocaine.&#8221; It was designed
to obtain anesthesia with cocaine with the elimination of
the toxic effects of the latter.</p>

<p>There are decided disadvantages to the filling up of the
tissues with fluid; healing is delayed; relations are distorted
and coaptation of the edges is difficult. This is probably
the method of selection where an indefinite amount of
manipulation is expected and where the length and depth
of the incision may need to be augmented. A large quantity
of a very weak solution is employed and the tissues in all
directions are injected until visibly distended.</p>

<p><b>Nerve Blocking Method.</b> By injecting a small quantity
of a fairly strong anesthetic solution either directly into a
nerve or beneath its sheath, the entire area supplied by it
will be anesthetized. This method of nerve blocking may
be spoken of as <i>endoneural</i> when the injection is made directly
into the nerve trunk, and <i>perineural</i> when made into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
its sheath or immediately outside of the nerve. The injection
of fluid around nerves too small to inject directly is
also spoken of as perineural nerve blocking. (Hertzler).</p>

<h4><b>DRUGS EMPLOYED</b></h4>

<p>The essential qualities of a good local anesthetic are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Reliability in producing anesthesia.</p>
<p>2. Constitutional and local harmlessness.</p>
<p>3. Non-irritating qualities.</p>
<p>4. Ability to be rendered aseptic by boiling.</p>
</div>

<p>No one local anesthetic can be exclusively relied upon
to fulfill all of these requirements at all times. Each one
has its advocates and from the large number offered, it is
possible to select several which, while not being perfect,
are preferable to cocaine in that they obviate the disagreeable
train of symptoms peculiar to that drug.</p>

<p>By local anesthetics are understood certain chemical
compounds, weak solutions of which, when brought in contact
with sensory nerves paralyze them without lastingly
injuring them. This effect is dependent upon the presence
in these agents of certain atom groups which Ehrlich named
<i>anesthiferous</i>. It is possible that just these atom groups
enter into certain chemical combinations with the nerve substance
and that the nerve thus remains paralyzed until the
newly formed compounds are split up and the poison is
washed away by the circulating blood.</p>

<p>Cocaine is the original type of a local anesthetic. Einhorn
has made possible its synthetic production and has
also opened the field for a great number of experiments of
scientific and practical importance leading to the discovery
of new local anesthetics obtained by exchanging the non-anesthiferous
atom groups of cocaine for other groups different
for each of the various new agents; thus eucaine,
orthoform, anesthesine, alypin, and others have been obtained.</p>

<p><b>Cocaine</b> occurs as a white, crystalline powder, readily
soluble in water and in alcohol. It is an alkaloid which effects
all living protoplasm. It first excites, then paralyzes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
In greater concentrations it paralyzes immediately. Its
effect is very ephemeral, producing no lasting harm to the
cocainized protoplasm. Its effect is most readily understood
by assuming that cocaine poisons the protoplasm
by entering with it into combinations which are easily broken
up. The products of decomposition, among which cocaine
cannot be recovered, are slightly or not at all poisonous
and are carried away by the circulation.</p>

<p><b>Effect on the Mucous Membrane.</b> The external application
of cocaine in solutions of varying strengths has been
of great service since its introduction by Roller in 1884,
and many operations on the eye and on its coverings are
now greatly facilitated, by reason of its use. Small quantities
only are required, hence there is little fear of its
toxicity. Its anesthetic qualities by contact are also made
use of in operations in and about the nose and throat. Here
comparatively mild solutions are used liberally but care
must be exercised against its noxious effects; it is usually
employed in freshly prepared solutions which are held to
be less toxic. Where extensive areas of mucous membranes
are to be anesthetized, as in the rectum or urethra or bladder,
one of the less toxic drugs is preferable.</p>

<p><b>Strength of Solutions.</b> In the eye, it is customary to
employ a 4 per cent. solution. For work in the nose, 2 per
cent. is generally considered sufficient. In the latter connection,
it is often combined with adrenalin solution in
small amounts to mitigate its depressing effects as well as
to control bleeding. The latter effect is but transient and
is omitted by many as unsatisfactory because of the more
profuse subsequent hemorrhage. In this respect cocaine
and adrenalin are similar. They both cause constriction of
the minute superficial vessels and immediate blanching of
the membrane; work in the nose is hence greatly facilitated,
the field of operation being clear and enlarged by the shrinkage
of the encroaching membrane, but it is incumbent upon
the operator to keep his patient under observation at least
an hour after the completion of the operation that he may
be certain of the degree of hemorrhage after the effects of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the drugs have passed away. For the above reason many
operators prefer a general anesthetic or one of the local
anesthetic drugs which exert no constrictor action so that
they may know, <i>ab initio</i>, the exact degree of bleeding.</p>

<p>Whatever drug is used, strong solutions are seldom
necessary for application to the mucous membranes but the
necessary time for its absorption is a prime requisite. To
secure anesthesia of the conjunctiva and cornea, the solution
is dropped into the eye at the outer canthus and as it
flows off with the tears, it must be replenished three or
four times until anesthesia is accomplished. In the nose,
a spray over the site of incision or a pledget of cotton saturated
with the anesthetic solution and allowed to rest in
contact with that locality, will suffice. The flow of mucus
from the nasal mucosa is stimulated by the presence of the
cotton pledget and it soon becomes entirely coated with
a thick mucus which no longer is able to impart to the membrane
its anesthetic solution and must therefore be renewed
several times before complete insensibility of the part is
assured. The topical application of a strong solution on
a cotton wound applicator to a limited area or spot is also
efficient.</p>

<p><b>Application by Injection.</b> In order to bring the anesthetic
in contact with the nerves, it is necessary, where a
skin surface is to be incised, to inject the solution as already
described. The technic, previously detailed, applies
here, and any of the methods may be employed for the injection
of solutions of cocaine, some preferring a single
method to the exclusion of all others. The locality to be
treated will also influence the operator as to method.</p>

<p><b>Endermically.</b> The endermic method is the one most
generally employed in securing cocaine local anesthesia by
injection. The papillary layer of the skin is well infiltrated
with a mild solution (one-eighth per cent. to one-half per
cent.), frequently with adrenalin 1-1000, in the proportion
of 15 to 20 drops to the ounce of the solution. The strongest
of the formulas of Schleich may also be used for endermic
infiltration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>The skin is injected to a fair degree of tension and a
white ridge marks the line of injection which should be
sufficiently extensive to permit the manipulation of the cut
edges.</p>

<p><b>Edemitization.</b> Schleich&#8217;s solutions are here of extreme
value because large amounts of solution are necessary
to produce the degree of distention required because
of the minute quantity of cocaine present, though the added
salt and morphine assist considerably.</p>

<p><b>Nerve Blocking and Perineural Blocking.</b> Here a
stronger solution must be employed; 1 per cent., or even
stronger, is injected in small quantities, either into the substance
of the nerve or under its sheath, as already described.</p>

<p><b>Strength of Solution.</b> Schleich has worked out a method
whereby very weak solutions of cocaine may be used advantageously.
His plan is to enhance the action of the drug
by the admixture of morphine in minute quantities and of
sodium chloride in proper strength. These substances, in
themselves, were found to possess anesthetic powers. Large
quantities of Schleich&#8217;s solutions may be injected&#8212;even
several ounces, without ill effects as they contain so little
cocaine. The formulas used by him are:</p>

<p>It will be seen that the strength of cocaine in the respective
solutions is from one-fifth to one-hundredth of a
gram.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The solutions used in the early days of cocaine anesthesia
were much stronger than were found necessary afterward
and it has now become the rule to employ weak solutions
and to give them time to penetrate the tissues. The
less toxic action of mild solutions, even when like amounts
of the drug are employed, makes it incumbent upon the
operator to follow this plan and the element of time is so
important in the matter of securing a perfect local anesthesia
that it is customary to wait fifteen or twenty minutes
after the completion of the injection before making
the incision. The weakest solution possible is the one of
choice in the use of this anesthesia.</p>

<p><b>Toxicology.</b> The repeated use of cocaine in the same
patient should be avoided on account of the danger of establishing
the cocaine habit. The drug should be given
with the greatest care, especially in operations about the
head, neck, face, and urethra, as several deaths and many
alarming cases of syncope, delirium and paralysis or tetanic
fixation of the respiratory muscles have followed its
use. Because of its marked depressing effect upon vital
organs, it should never be given unless the patient is in
the recumbent position. The administration of one drop of
a one per cent. solution of trinitrin given at the first onset
of the constitutional effects and repeated if necessary every
five minutes, will entirely prevent any unpleasant effects
as it is a true physiologic antidote.</p>

<p>If the surgeon has a case in which he intends to use
large amounts of cocaine, it is best to have at hand and
ready for use the following agents: a hypodermic and a
rectal syringe, a battery, cardiac and respiratory stimulants,
oxygen, and a catheter.</p>

<p>If the patient becomes very delirious and is in no way
depressed, chloral or hyoscine should be given. In all cases
of cocaine poisoning the patient should be catheterized to
prevent re-absorption and should then be treated symptomatically.</p>

<p>Strong solutions should never be employed for any purpose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
except in cases where, by previous experience with
the mild ones, it is known that no idiosyncrasy exists.</p>

<p>The central nervous system, and next the sensory and
motor nerves, are affected by cocaine. Respiratory paralysis
follows the introduction of appreciable amounts of cocaine
into the circulation and respiratory depression may
follow the introduction of smaller quantities. A given quantity
of the drug in great dilution will, under normal conditions,
give no toxic symptoms, whereas the use of the
same amount in a more concentrated form will give rise to
pallor, cyanosis and even syncope and collapse. It is said
that a maximum dose of cocaine can never be fixed; this,
however, seems of less importance than knowing the minimum
dose, for while it is true that many bear it well, this
drug so frequently gives rise to toxic symptoms, and the
idiosyncrasy for it is so common, that one can never be
certain of an exact dosage. Various pharmacopias place
the maximum dose at 0.05 grm. (about seven-eights of a
grain).</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that a great dilution of a given amount
makes for safety, we are astonished to learn that 7 c. c.
(about 2 drams), of a 1 per cent. solution introduced into
the urethra has caused death. (Czerny).</p>

<p>Hertzler cites numerous instances in which a few drops
of a more concentrated solution (2 per cent. to 4 per cent.)
have caused death. It is therefore obvious that the use of
this drug must be guarded by a technic so perfect that but
the smallest quantity of a very weak solution shall be
permitted to enter the circulation.</p>

<p><b>Adjuvants, Substitutes and Safeguards.</b> The numerous
disadvantages in the general use of this most efficient but
most treacherous local anesthetic have operated so strongly
that efforts have constantly been made to find a substance
which, when used with it, would correct its toxic effects.</p>

<p>The desirability of employing large quantities of an
anesthetic solution so as to enable the operator to infiltrate
large areas of tissue has led to the method of preparing
very dilute solutions and mixing them with various chemical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
substances which in themselves would act as mild anesthetics
and at the same time increase the diffusibility of the cocaine.
With any of these substances, cocaine still remains toxic
and the quantity injected must be kept account of when an
operation of any extent is being performed even though
the solution be never so mild.</p>

<p>A valuable preventive to this absorption is found in
the application of a constricting band or tourniquet to impede
the return circulation and allow the washing out of
much of the drug before the obstruction is removed. It is
evident that no method has yet been devised whereby the
use of cocaine is rendered safe and it is for this reason that
chemists throughout the world have sought to produce either
a new anesthetic drug or to evolve a drug synthetically, from
cocaine, minus its toxicity. This has been done, but cocaine
still has its adherents because of its superior qualities.</p>

<p>Quinine and urea hydrochloride is one of the new substitutes
which has found much favor. Among the synthetic
derivatives may be mentioned alypin, novocaine, stovaine,
betaeucaine, tropacocaine, anesthesin, subcutin and many
others. Each of these has its advocates and all of them
have some advantage over cocaine; they have disadvantages
as well, which, however, in the hands of skilled operators,
may be overcome.</p>

<p><b>Quinine and Urea Hydrochloride.</b> Among the quinine
salts and combinations, the above has found most favor. It
consists of a molecule of quinine hydrochloride and one of
urea. It occurs as a fine crystalline powder and is readily
soluble in water, forming an acid solution.</p>

<p>This substance is one of the most recent and best substitutes
for cocaine, being capable of a wide range of usefulness
and practically devoid of any toxicity. It causes
redness on being injected and, in strong solutions, may delay
healing considerably, this constituting the main disadvantage
to its use. After the use of this anesthetic, primary
union is not usual.</p>

<p>In a one per cent. solution, anesthesia is accomplished
by any of the methods already described. Weaker solutions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
require a more perfect technic, and are therefore not generally
employed. They, however, are indicated where it is
imperative to secure primary union and when for some
reason no other local anesthetic is available. The scar
formation which almost always follows the use of this
anesthetic would indicate that some other drug be employed
in operations about the face and neck. This anesthetic is
preferred by many because of its safety in large quantities
and because of the length of insensibility following the
injection of solutions of from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent.
strength.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding knowledge of the facts above enumerated
as to the difficulty of primary union and the likelihood
of scar formation in connection with the use of urea and
urea-hydrochloride for purposes of local anesthesia, this
drug is still considered a most valuable and useful one for
providing local anesthesia for operative purposes.</p>

<p><b>Novocaine.</b> This drug is one-seventh as toxic as cocaine
but is also weaker in action. It does not cause vascular
constriction but has a preliminary vasodilator action. Like
quinine, it has a decidedly irritating action when injected.
It has a decidedly toxic effect when used in stronger solutions
than 2 per cent. and causes tonic and clonic spasm.
In a 1 per cent. solution it is probably safest and best as
an anesthetic and one-half ounce of such a solution may be
injected without fear of unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>Its dose is said to be about seven grains, but this may
often be the cause of alarming symptoms, and half of this
quantity would perhaps be a safe limit. The duration of
anesthesias of fairly strong solutions is about fifteen minutes;
the action is more prolonged if used with adrenalin.</p>

<p>Various combinations of drugs besides adrenalin are
employed with novocaine. Fischer recommends its use with
thymol, but even so, it is not efficient for a longer period
than twenty or twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Novocaine is frequently used in alcoholic solutions for
injection in neuralgic subjects. The commercial tablet of
novocaine and adrenalin is convenient for office use.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Alypin.</b> This substance occurs as a crystalline powder,
easily soluble in water, alcohol and ether, and makes a
neutral solution.</p>

<p>Alypin is in every respect the equal of cocaine though
not quite as strong. Schleich has found that its use, in conjunction
with minute quantities of cocaine, permitted of a
reduction of the entire amount of anesthetics necessary to
accomplish insensibility.</p>

<p>In its use on mucous membranes it does not cause any
anemia and therefore no secondary bleeding occurs. This
is a great advantage also in the examination of mucous
membrane lined cavities, such as the eye, nose, throat and
urethra, inasmuch as after the application of cocaine, the
blanching of the membrane conveys no idea of the real
condition of the parts.</p>

<p>Because of the results he obtained, Schleich now recommends
the following solutions for infiltration:</p>

<p>For other operative procedures of a minor character, it
has been found that one-fourth per cent. to one-eighth per
cent. is sufficient. For application to mucous membranes,
as in the urethra, nose and throat, 1 per cent. to 2 per cent.
has proved effective.</p>

<p><b>Stovaine.</b> Stovaine is used more for spinal anesthesia
than for local purposes; it is said to work well in inflamed
tissues.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Several drugs have been used because of their lessened
toxicity and many are constantly being tried but to be
abandoned because of their inefficiency or irritating qualities.
None of them are as efficient as cocaine and the weak
solutions of Schleich are about as active as stronger solutions
of many of these and are not more toxic.</p>

<p>Among the other cocaine substitutes in general use are
betaeucaine, tropacocain, anesthesin, and subcutin.</p>

<p>These all find a special field of usefulness, but for
general work, are limited, because of some disadvantages
which each and all of them possess.</p>

<p>Individual selection plays an important part in the
use of a local anesthetic, and one operator, by practical
experience, may obtain results with a given drug, which
another fails to achieve.</p>

<p>The essential feature to be remembered by the practising
chiropodist is, that the use of any drug employed for
anesthetizing purposes, even though but local, should be
safeguarded in every way.</p>

<p><b>Cold.</b> The methods of using ether, rhigolene, or ice
and salt, to produce cold, are slow and unsatisfactory. If
cold is to be used to produce local anesthesia the most
efficient and convenient method of applying it is by means of
<i>ethyl chloride</i>. This fluid is very volatile and is best controlled
by having it in air-tight tubes. When not in use, a
valve covering one end of the tube prevents leakage. When
the valve is pressed upon, the orifice of the tube is opened
and the heat of the hand forces out a fine stream of the
liquid which is directed upon the parts to be frozen. Rapid
evaporation causes intense cold. The nozzle should be held
about fifteen inches from the area to be acted upon. When
the spray strikes the integument, redness almost instantly
results but in a few seconds the part becomes hard and white.
This condition indicates local insensibility and lasts about
two minutes. If the action is slow, it can be much hastened
by gently blowing upon the parts to increase the rapidity
of evaporation.</p>

<p>The refrigeration method of local anesthesia is of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
limited usefulness and is recommended only for the opening
of felons and abscesses, for removing wens from the scalp
and back, and for producing a painless area in which a
puncture is to be made. It must be borne in mind that
sloughing and ulceration of the skin are liable to follow the
use of cold.</p>

<p>Work under this form of anesthesia must be done with
rapidity not always consistent with thoroughness, and should
therefore be employed only when a single incision or
puncture is indicated.</p>

<p>The pain incident to subsequent thawing is severe and,
in general, is about as hard to bear as an incision without
an anesthetic.</p>

<p>For the purposes of practical podiatry, the chiropodist
is advised to use a substitute for cocaine rather than the
cocaine itself when local anesthesia is necessary. In the
clinics of the School of Chiropody of New York, novocaine,
quinine and urea hydrochloride, and alypin are preferred,
and no single instance of toxemia has ever been experienced.
There have been cases in which the anesthesia did not prove
thoroughly effective, but, in the main, these drugs have well
answered the purposes of their use.</p>
